[The music Reminded by Drowning Pool plays]

Bardock: Frieza! I'm coming for you, you murderous self-serving traitor! It's over!

Frieza's soldiers: All hail, Lord Frieza!

Bardock: [Chuckling] No way, Frieza. You lived long enough! Actually it's been too long far for my taste. Frieza, listen up! We quit! All of us! Got it!? We don't work for you anymore! We're free! You can find someone else to do your dirty work! Oh yeah! [Chuckling] There's one last thing... [Charges a Final Spirit Cannon]

Narrator: Deployed on a routine military operation, the Saiyan baby Kakarot flies toward Earth, missing the deadly surprise attack on his home planet. His father Bardock confronts the assailants, Frieza and his entire army, alone.

Bardock: This is for all the people we killed in your name! Here, have it! [launches a Final Spirit Cannon]

Frieza: [Evil Laughter]

[uses his Death Ball, as the Final Spirit Cannon has no effect on the Death Ball]

Bardock: No way!

[Everyone screams, as Bardock gets hit by the Death Ball, causing his armor to disintegrate; inside a nearby spaceship, Cooler and his henchmen watch Bardock's death]

Dore: That's the guy right there, Bardock.

Salza: He doesn't look so frightening to me. Anyway, he's space dust now. And there goes the whole monkey farm. Now, this is light entertainment. [Salza notices Goku in his space pod.]

Hm? What's this? Someone's getting away! Magnify the image!

Neiz: Right, I'm on it Salza!

Salza: I want an interior view as well!

Neiz: That's it, got it.

Salza: Where does he think he's going?!

Neiz: It looks like he's heading towards a planet called Earth! Intercept course?

Salza: Yes.

Cooler: Belay that order.

Doore: Sire!

Neiz: Yes sir!

Salza: But.. someone is escaping!

Cooler: Frieza is the one in charge of this quadrant, let him clean up his own mess. I've got seven planets to destroy by the end of the day. Why should I allow myself to get behind schedule just to cover his mistake?

Besides, he's just a Saiyan child. He's no threat to us. [Cooler stares at Frieza laughing on the monitor.]

Ah, look at him! What foolishness! He's so pleased with that himself he's blinded by his arrogant pride! That could be King Vegeta on that space pod for all he knows!

You've got a lot to learn, brother. Let's get out of here!

[Opening]

[at Roshi's Island, Goku trains and launches Kamehameha on the water]

Master Roshi: Look at that! I can see clear to the main land, Goku! That's amazing!

Goku: Awesome huh? Watch this. I can make the walls go higher!

Master Roshi (thinking to himself): Remarkable. He's never trained harder, but he's so relaxed and talkative about it. Beating Frieza changed him.

[[[Goku's House]]]

Gohan: [Doing work] There... divide that by 10...

Chi-Chi: Hi! I thought my little scholar might be thirsty. Here's some tea. [Notices Icarus in window] Hm? Hey! What do think you're doing? I know what you're up to. Now you get out of here.

Goku: Icarus, leave Gohan alone, he's trying to finish his homework.

Chi-Chi: What? Did you hear what your father just said? He told Icarus to leave you alone because you were doing your... homework. Goku? Are you feeling ok, honey?

Goku: Oh yeah, I'm feeling just fine.

Chi-Chi: Are you sure you don't have a fever, Goku? You sound a little strange.

Goku: No, I feel great. I just want Gohan to finish his homework.

Chi-Chi: Yep, I knew it, I knew it. Goku has never cared if you finish your homework. Gohan, I'm afraid there's something seriously wrong with your father. I wonder if all this fighting has finally knocked a few screws loose in Goku's head. That's it! He must have bruised his brain...

Gohan: Betcha never thought you could fly this fast. Did ya? [Giggling, as Salza, Neiz and Dore pop out]

Salza: So, going somewhere, monkey boy?

Gohan: Uh oh! Icarus, let's get out of here, quick!

Dore: Let em have it, Salza!

Neiz: [Laughing]

[Salza launches his Finger Beam attack on Icarus' wings as Gohan loses control, and the music Falling Down by Breaking Point plays]

Gohan: It's okay I gotcha. [Dore kicks Gohan causing Icarus to fall in the woods] Icarus! [The Armored Squadron hit Gohan causing Dore to grab Gohan}

Dore: [chuckling] Huh? Hey, whatcha got in the bag there, monkey boy. [uses his hands to get the bad] Give it here. Give it. Alright! That's it! You're going bye-bye, kid! [Gohan growls in frustration] I call this mine can-opener with your attack. [he gets blasted in the back by an energy blast]

Neiz: Dore!

Dore: Who did that!?

Piccolo: That would be me!

Salza: A Namek? Out here?

Dore: [about Planet Namek] Why isn't that toad on his own world where he belongs?

Neiz: Frieza blew it up.

Dore: Oh, oh yeah. Yeah.

Gohan: Yeah. Piccolo.

Dore: [to Piccolo] It's all over for you, Namek! You're going to die!

Piccolo: Not likely. [takes off his turban] I've seen you fight.

Dore: I'M GOING RIP YOU APART!!! [Launches up and punches Piccolo's cape] Where'd he go!

[Piccolo appears and hits Dore in the helmet causing him to fall to the ground]

Dore: DARN IT!! I...CAN'T... [blasts Doore, he screams and dies and explodes]

Neiz: Dore. [to Piccolo] You're dead! [growls in frustration, when using a pink shock wave with Piccolo fighting with Salza] Have it! [blasts Piccolo]

Salza: [Evil laughter] You look like a buch of dear caught in the headlights! [Laughs evilly] You lose suckers! Now die! [Piccolo launches a Special Beam Cannon and shot Salza in the back, as he starts gasping, and falls over]

Goku and Krillin: Huh?

Gohan: I don't see him. [giggles] Piccolo! I know you're there! Come out! Piccolo!

[later, Piccolo drinks water, and regenerates as the song Phoneix by Breaking Point plays]

[Credits]


Narrator: Planet Vegeta. Many years ago, a small child was born.

[Baby crying]

Narrator: [continues] Unheralded and unattended by its father or mother, the baby cried out, making its lonely plea to the universe. The Saiyans were a people of war, and like all Saiyan babies, the child was destined to fight.

Planthorr: My goodness, that's one loud kid. Yes, he'll be great, watch.

Malaka: That's a bold prediction for the son of a low-class soldier. Let's see ... Bardock's son, huh? Planthorr, I wouldn't stake my reputation on that prediction if I were you.

Planthorr: Hmm ... you just wait.

[Opens chamber baby is in]

Planthorr: Come here, Malaka. Do you hear that?

Malaka: Hmm?

Planthorr: That's the cry of a great warrior. Let's see ... Kakarot. Remember that name.

[On planet Kanassa]

Demetrious: Sir, it's the full moon, just like in the vision.

Kanassan Commander: Yes, Demetrious indeed, it is about to begin. This is the hour for which we have prepared.

Demetrious: Yes, commander.

[Four Great Ape's appear]

[Four Kanassan's attack, to no avail]

[Great Ape Tora disintegrates them with a blast from his mouth]

Kanassan: Don't lose heart, my faithful Kanass. This is our duty. We must see it through until the end.

[Demetrious fires a beam and draws blood from Great Ape Shugesh]

Demetrious: Commander, I have drawn blood. Now the foot must rise and fall.

Kanassan Commander: You have done well, my friend. I will meet you at the door.

[Demetrious then gets stepped on]

[The next day]

Tora: That was a heck of a party, wasn't it?

Fasha: If you say so. I don't remember any of it.

Tora: You're a typical ape, Fasha.

Fasha: Aw, shut up. I don't see how you guys remember anyway. It's elephants that aren't supposed to forget, not apes.

Borgos: I'm with you Fasha. For me it's like waking up from a dream. You kind of remember it all, but then it just slips away.

Shugesh: I don't remember much either, but I remember the crusty little devil that gave me this. [Shugesh rubs scar]

Fasha: Bardock says he remembers everything.

Tora: [Chuckles] Right, don't make me laugh Fasha. Bardock might remember every second of every battle, but he remembers nothing of his personal life. Allow me to demonstrate. Bardock, do you remember what day your son was born?

Bardock: No. But that was a long time ago.

Fasha: It was not you lazy bum. Yesterday? Come on, you need to go see the little tike. You have enough time to stop in before our next assignment.

Bardock: Visit him, huh? How nice. Father-son bonding. Why should I? They'll just send him away.

Fasha: Hm. Bardock. You're a jerk.

Shugesh: Hey guys, why did we fight for this dump anyway, huh? Is Frieza out of his tiny little mind or something?

Bardock: Yeah, but not in this case. I think this planet has special energy or so I've heard.

Tora: Yeah, I heard the same thing. You're supposed to be able to develop physicic powers if you live here. Like being able to read minds, see the future and stuff like that.

Bardock: Frieza's such a paranoid freak. He'd jump at the chance to be able to read minds.

Borgos: That's a scary thought. Frieza really bought his-

[A Kanassan (Toolo) emerges from pile of rubble]

Toolo: I wish you baboons could read minds so you could have heard the thoughts of my troops as you slaughtered them!

[Toolo charges at Bardock, teleports behind him and strikes him on the back of his neck]

[Shugesh strikes Toolo with his knee, and Tora blasts him]

Bardock: What the heck is going on?

Toolo: I have transmuted your destructive force into a more tolerable energy. So you will all die.

Bardock: Yeah? We'll see about that. Goodbye.

Toolo: Wait! You have come here seeking psychic power. Well, I have given it to you, Bardock.

Bardock: He reads minds.

Toolo: You can too now. Bardock, you have the power now too.

Bardock: Me? What are you talking about?

Toolo: The one who seeks the power of Frieza will never have it. But I have given it to you as a gift, Bardock, so that you could see ...

Bardock: See what?

Toolo: See the horror of your end, just like we had to. [Starts laughing]

Bardock: Shut up! [Fires blast at Toolo]

Toolo: Ahhhhhh! [Toolo is disintegrated]

Shugesh: It's dead barbecue. Heh, you never know what you're going to find under a rock these days. Pretty freaky creature eh? Hey. Yo. Hello?

Tora: Stop fooling around Bardock.

[Bardock falls to the ground]

Tora: Hey!

Fasha: Bardock!

Tora: What the heck's going on?

Shugesh: Bardock!

Borgos: He's out cold.

Shugesh: I know that freaky thing had something up his sleeve.

Fasha: Don't you dare die, Bardock.

[On another planet]

[Prince Vegeta is in a room, surrounded by five Saibamen. They try to attack, but he dodges every attack]

Soldier: Did you see that?!

Soldier 2: Yes, I see it all the time. That's Prince Vegeta. He's the best.

Soldier: There's no way!

Soldier 2: Not for any kid you've ever known.

[The Saibamen pounce at Vegeta, who uses an Explosive Wave to scatter them. He then kills them all with Finger Beams.]

Soldier: Unbelievable!

Soldier 2: I told you.

Soldier: My gosh! What's he going to be like when he's full grown?!

Nappa: Nobody really knows that. Yet. But take my advice and stay on his good side.

Soldier: Sure yeah! Gah.

Vegeta: Open up before I-

Soldier: Ah yikes! Sorry sir!

Nappa: [Chuckles] You're the best, Prince.

Vegeta: Stop kissing up, Nappa!

[Traveling on a sort of escalator]

Vegeta: This place bores me! I want another combat assignment!  No more drills!  Man, Frieza!  The day will soon be here that we won't take any more orders from him!  You watch!

Nappa:  Huh?  You think so?

Vegeta:  I know so!

Nappa:  I'd love that!

Zarbon:  Pardon me, Lord Frieza, Sir!  Interesting news!  Planet Kanassa has been occupied as of last night, Sire!

Frieza:  Oh?

Zarbon:  Yes, Sire!  The Kanass have been eradicated. The planet is yours!

Dodoria:  Kanassa!  That job has been in the pool for months!  I thought we'd have to handle that one ourselves!

Zarbon:  No, a band of Saiyans took it!

Frieza:  Saiyans...

Dodoria:  Wow!  Their elite teams are becoming comparable to our own!

Zarbon:  Actually, it was a band of their low-level soldiers!

Dodoria:  No low-levels could take Kanassa!  No!  These are standouts!  The Saiyans are quickly becoming our best fighters!  Am I right?

Zarbon:  Yes, Dodoria!  Without a doubt!  They're much stronger now!  It's amazing!  In a small group on a full moon, they're hard to beat!

Dodoria:  What?  Are you scared of them, Zarbon?

Zarbon:  No, certainly not!  I'm just saying that we need to keep an eye on them, that's all!  Like this Bardock who led the assault on the Kanassans!  What if he and his group teamed up with young Vegeta and a handful of other great fighters!  How would you like to tangle with that bunch on a full moon, Dodoria?

Frieza:  Only a fool would welcome that scenario!

Zarbon: Yes, sire!  Prince Vegeta?  What do you think you're doing?

Dodoria:  Frieza didn't send for you, kid!  You know that no one sees Lord Frieza unless he calls them first!

Vegeta:  Look,  I'm bored!  This is lame!  I need an assignment!

Zarbon:  Hm!  Who do you think you are?  I oughta teach you a lesson in etiquette, Prince!

Frieza:  Give him an assignment Zarbon, immediately!

Zarbon:  Lord Freiza!

Frieza:  The boy doesn't mean any harm, Zarbon!  He just hasn't learned how to control his passion!  Give him the hardest assignment that you have, and Vegeta... do come back alive!

Vegeta:  I will, Sire!  Thank you very much!

Frieza: You don't have to thank me, Vegeta!  You certainly earn your keep around here!  You might want to mind your manners a little better though!

Vegeta:  Sire!

(cut back to Bardock)

Melakka:  If he keeps this up, he's going to be become stronger than King Vegeta!

Planthor:  No kidding!  Bardock, he comes back from every mission half dead!  My gosh!

Melakka:  He's crazy!  What kind of low-level soldier would go to a planet like Kanassa with only a handful of men?

Planthor:  I think he needs to be retested, his case is unusual!

Melakka:  I agree, Planthor!

Torah:  How is he, Melakka?

Melakka:  Let's see here... yes, physically, sure... he's ready!  Mentally, I'm not so sure!  There's a slight change in his brainwave patterns!

Torah:  Brainwaves?

Shugesh:  That doesn't sound to good, Torah!  We'd better handle this one on our own!

Torah:  Right!  We should be okay on Meet!  Well, goodbye, old friend!

Melakka:  Hmmm?  Whoa!

Bardock:  A planet being destroyed!  Was it Vegeta?  No!  It couldn't be!  But wait, the baby, my son... he sees it, too!  It's him... being sent out!  So lonely!  Torah!  I don't understand!  What does my young son have to do with you?  Why am I seeing these things?  It doesn't make sense!  My son, he's become a warrior... but he's different from us!  What happened?  What's wrong with him?  Why am I seeing this!  No... no!

Melakka:  Planthor!  Get him out of there!  Something serious is going on!

Planthor:  Open the hatch, Melakka!  Thank goodness you're alright, you gave us a scare!  Bardock, what happened?

Bardock:  I don't know ... wow!  It was like I was having a nightmare but I wasn't asleep!  At least I don't think I was asleep!

Planthor:  I think it would be wise to take it easy for a while, Bardock!

Bardock:  Oh, yeah?  Well, I wouldn't know, I'm not wise!

Planthor:  You're not?

Bardock:  No!

Planthor:  Oh, I think you're wise!  How else could you take on the assignments that you do and still be alive?

Bardock:  I know how to fight!  That's all!  It doesn't take a whole lot of brains to be a great fighter!  Which reminds me, where's Torah?  I thought I heard him in here earlier!

Planthor:  You and your team were ordered to go to Planet Meet by Frieza himself!

Bardock:  What?  Frieza! So we're finally getting the recognition we deserve!  And those bums take of without me, huh?

Planthor: No!  Wait!  Bardock!  You need to rest!

(Bardock pauses for a brief moment and then cuts to him standing in front of a nursery with Kakarrot crying inside.)

Bardock:  Huh?  Not again!  Oh, thank goodness!  You're real this time!  Man, you sure have some powerful lungs!  Well, look kid, I'll catch you later!

Commander:  Wait!

Bardock:  Huh?

Commander:  You have come here seeking psychic power!!  Well, I have given it to you, Bardock!

Bardock: (sees Kakarrot's plaque) Kakarot, huh?  You see it, too, somehow!  Don't you? (scouter starts beeping) Only an average power level!  I thought you were special! (runs off)

(cut to another planet with Borgos getting killed)

Torah:  Borgos!  No!  Darn you, brutes!  Why?  Tell me!  Why are you doing this?  I don't understand!

Frieza Henchman:  Poor baby!

Dodoria:  What don't you understand, Torah?  That you are weak?  What a mess you are!  Ahh, Torah...  You shouldn't have forgotten that you are weak! (picks him up)

Torah:  What do you mean?  We serve Frieza!  You know that!

Dodoria:  Yes, I know!  Frieza's very impressed with your service record!  Yes, too impressed!  It seems he wants you dead!

Torah:  What?  Why?

Dodoria:  I don't want to flatter you but Frieza thought that you were getting too strong!

Frieza Henchman2:  Cool, huh?  You should consider this a promotion!

Torah:  No!  Look!  It's not fair!  Everything that we've done was for him!  How can he do this?

Dodoria:  You fool!  It's not what you've done!  It's what you might have done in the future!

Torah:  Then no one's safe from Frieza!  Not even you!

Dodoria:  Is that so?

(Dodoria throws Toma in the air and punches him in the jaw before cutting to Bardock arriving at the planet)

Bardock: (sees multiple corpses of the planet's inhabitants)  It looks like they plowed right through this one.  I guess I taught those knuckleheads something about fighting after all!  Yep, still here!  Lousy bums, probably still celebrating! (sees the corpses of his crew) Shugesh, Fasha, Borgos!  What happened?

Torah: (weakly and coughs a few times) B- Bardock!

Bardock:  Torah!  Oh my gosh!  Torah!  Don't tell me you let those Meet-heads do this to you guys!

Torah:  No!  No way, come on!  You should know us better than that, Bardock!

Bardock:  I didn't think so!  Well, what happened then?

Torah:  We... we were ambushed by Dodoria and his men!

Bardock:  Frieza's the one that ordered us here!

Torah:  Yes, it was a set-up.  Frieza, he wants us all dead!

Bardock:  But why?  I mean, after all we've done?  It doesn't make sense!  We took the jobs that even his elites wouldn't mess with and we still won!

Torah:  It's true!  Isn't it!  We were getting to be the best, Frieza's scared!

Bardock:  Scared of what?

Torah:  Of you, Bardock!  Frieza's scared of you!  Don't you see!  He's scared of what you might become!  You're getting too strong!  Good luck, old friend!  I'm sorry that I can't...(closes his eyes and dies)

Bardock:  Goodbye, Torah!  You were my best friend!  So this is what it's come to.  This is how we're rewarded for our hard work!  We tried so hard to please Freeza.  My crew, Borgos, Fasha!  Those pigs!  So they thought we were getting too strong! (removes Toma's handkerchief and his face) Shugesh!  I promise somehow I'll get them for this Shugesh! (starts tying the bloody handkerchief on his forehead) I'll die trying!  Frieza's taken our loyalty, and paid us back in our own blood! (scouter beeps and Bardock turns around) I thought there was a foul smell in the air!  So you're the ones!

Frieza henchman1:  Bardock!  You crack me up!  We had some good laughs with your crew earlier, too!  You should have been there!

Bardock:  You're right!  I should have been there!

Frieza henchman1:  Do you really think that it would have made a difference, Bardock?  I mean really!

Frieza henchman2: (Frieza henchman2 fires a bunch of ki blasts at Bardock)There, that should do it! (scouter beeps as Bardock appears above him) Hm? (Bardock hits him hard on the skull)  Ahhh!! (starts falling to the ground)

Frieza henchman1:  Ahh!  What the? (he and his comrades fire a ki blast at Bardock, who vanishes before all three blasts connects)  Where the heck did he go?

Frieza henchman3:  He can't hide forever!  Huh?

Frieza henchman1:  Huh, Bardock?  Huh?  What?  Ahh!  There you are!  Die you fool! (fires a ki blast through the smoke, accidentally shooting down his teammate)  Huh?  Oh, no!  What have I done?  Darn it!

Frieza henchman4:  Ingenious move, he's no slouch!  Better watch out!

Frieza henchman5:  Me watch out!  He's just a low level, we're the low-level, we're the elites!  Now let's go (both of them starts charging at Bardock)

(Bardock starts having another vision)

Goku: (through vision) Kaio-Ken Attack!  Aaahh!

(Barock gets kneed in the face)

(Frieza henchman4 grabs Bardock from behind as Frieza henchman5 proceeds to punch him in the stomach. Bardock starts having another vision.)

Vegeta: Not bad, Kakarot!  For a low level! (pounds him to fall to the ground)

(Bardock thinking as he's getting pummeled in reality)

(Bardock manages to flip over, causing Frieza henchman4 to get in the way of the attack)

(Frieza henchman4 gets punched in the back by Mango, coughing up blood)

(Badrock breaks free and fires a ki blast)

(both he and Frieza henchman4 scream as they get disintegrated by the blast)

Bardock:  That was from my crew to you!  So those were some of Frieza's elites!  I can see why he might be worried! Now what? (scouter starts beeping) (turns to see Dodoria)

Dodoria:  Mmm!  Unfortunate business isn't it, Bardock?

Bardock:  Darn right!  Unfortunate for you, Dodoria!  Torah told me that you're behind this!

Dodoria:  That blew him away!  Bardock, you should have remembered your place!

Someone who didn't even show up on the captions:  Commander Dodoria!  A message from Lord Frieza, sir!

Dodoria:  Oh?(charging up a Mouth Energy Wave)

(Bardock screams as he gets engulfed by the blast)

Someone who didn't even show up on the captions:  Lord Frieza has requested that you rendez-vous with his ship before it reaches Vegeta, sir!

Dodoria:  Frieza... planning something delicious no doubt!

Bardock: (muffled while under his teammates' bodies) (frees himself from under the pile and starts coughing) I'll get them... somehow, someway!  For you guys.  You weren't low-level soldiers!  You were stronger than most of their elites!  We'll meet again, my friends!  Sooner or later, we'll meet again!

(cut to Kakarrot inside a space pod)

Man3:  Hey, we've got one to go here!  Coordinate FX-50, his name is Kakarot!

Man4:  Kakarot, huh?  And which planet are they sending you to, little guy!  Let's see, Eeee Arth!

Man3:  Eeee Arth?

Man4:  Look Kakarot, we don't name 'em, we just send you there, little buddy!

Man3:  This pod is a go, let's move him out!

(cut to Freeza's ship)

Dodoria:  Mission accomplished, Sire!

Frieza:  Oh, really?  You sound so sure of yourself, Dodoria!

Zarbon:  Once again, you botched it up!

Dodoria:  I did not!

Zarbon:  You missed one, the leader.  Bardock!  He's still alive!

Dodoria:  You're wrong, I saw him die!

Zarbon:  Oh?  Then what's that there?

(Bardock's space pod is seen flying by Freeza's ship)

Dodoria:  Huh?  A Saiyan space-pod!  I don't believe it!  How could he have survived that?

Frieza:  Dodoria!  Perhaps this will teach you not to take things for granted!  To be more thorough with your work!

Dodoria: (stammers a few times before speaking) Lord Frieza, forgive me.  Please, Sire!  Let me go now!  Bardock, he's dead!  I'll be...

Frieza:  You'll be quite, Dodoria!  You're not going anywhere!  There's no need to chase after the bee anymore, I've decided to go straight for the hive!

Dodoria:  Sire?

Zarbon:  Yes, I see!  You've decided to extinguish the whole lot of them, Sire!

Frieza:  That's right!  You guessed it Zarbon!  If you want to get rid of weeds for good, you have to get them by the root!

Bardock:  Great, Frieza!  Aw, man... not good! (thinking) He's coming to Vegeta, I know he is!  I can feel it!  How bizarre!  It's as clear as day!  I can go inside of his mind!

(cut to Frieza)

Frieza:  Ah, yes!  Ease up!  There she is!  Beautiful, isn't she?  A rare gem indeed, as red as a blood ruby!

(cut to Kakarot's space pod closing on the launching platform)

Man5:  Stand clear of door seven!  Launching sequence has been initiated!

(Kakarot's space pod is seen flying by Bardock's space pod)

Bardock:   It's happening again!  Kakarot! (through vision sees Goku switching to child mode, switching to teen mode, and switching to adult form]

(cut to Kakarot's space pod rocketing into space)

(cut to Bardock's spacepod landing on the landing deck)

Man6:  Please clear the landing deck!  Pod landing in four seconds!  Three... two.. one...

(cut to Bardock coming out from his space pod laying on it)

Man7:  Bardock?  Hey, are you alright!

Bardock:  Yeah!  Please!  I need to go!  Move!

Man8:  You need to go straight to recovery, oh and hey!  You missed your son!  He just left!

Bardock:  Huh?  Just now?

Man8:  Yep!  He left just before you arrived, Sir!  Darn shame!  Yeah!  You only missed him by a matter of seconds!  I wish I would have known that it was you coming in, I could have delayed his departure!

Bardock:  Then it's true, all true!  I wasn't hallucinating!  My son, that planet!

Man8:  Are you okay, Sir!  Please!  You're injured!  Allow us to escort you to the recovery chambers!

Bardock:  That means that the other part of the vision must be true as well!  Vegeta!

Man8:  I'd be happy to accompany you sir!

Man7:  Oh my gosh, take a look at this would ya!  They really messed him up good this time!

Bardock:  That monster!  He's going to blow up the whole planet!  I've got to warn the others!  I've got to stop him somehow!

Commander:  The one who seeks the power, Frieza, will never have it!  But I have given it to you as a gift, Bardock!  So that you could see!  See the horror of your end, just like we had to!

Bardock:  Where am I?

Commander:  This is the future, Bardock!  This is what you killed my people for, isn't it?

Bardock:  My son?

Commander:  Yes, your son!  He's growing up to be a powerful warrior just like his father was!

Bardock:  Was?

Commander:  At this time you are long since dead!  You blow up with your planet!

Bardock:  No, Frieza!!

Commander:  Take heart, Bardock!  A savior has been born!  One who has the power to save the innocent from people like Frieza... and you!

Bardock:  NO!  I'm not going crazy!  It is the future!  I've got to let the others know!  If I'm able to see the future, there might be a chance to change it!

[a little note about "BarGuy" characters in the next scene.  Although I have at least thirteen "BarGuy"s, I know that some of those lines belong to the same characters.  However, I could not successfully match up the voices, so each line gets a new speaker, unless I actually see the speaker (6,7 only).  I will correct this little problem soon!]

(cut to a bar with many Saiyans socializing as Steppenwolf's "Bad to the Bone" plays in a radio)

BarGuy1:  So, whatd'ya say?

BarGal1:  You dog!

BarGuy2:  Whoa!

(cut to Bardock entering inside from a door then falling on a table on the right side of him)

BarGuy3:  Bardock!  What's wrong?

BarGuy4:  He got his butt kicked, that's what's wrong!

BarGuy5:  It's about time!

Bardock:  Listen, everybody!  It's Frieza!  He's coming for us!

BarGuy6:  Us?

BarGuy7:  You mean you, right?

Bardock:  No us!  You, me, everyone here!  It's true!  He's scared of us!  He wants us all dead!  My whole crew is dead thanks to that freak!

BarGuy8:  Bardock gets his tail whipped and it's the end of the world, right?  Maybe you goons should stop pretending to be elites! (Saiyan crowd starts laughing)

BarGuy6:  No kidding, Bardock!  Welcome to the real world, buddy-boy!

BarGuy7:  It hurts!  Don't it?

BarGuy9:  Let's tell him that we'll leave him alone if he bows down whenever he's in the presence of a Saiyan!

BarGuy10:  No, forget it!  That little worm is going to have to kiss my stinky feet!

Bardock:  Fools, you're dead!

BarGuy6:  Bow down in front of me Frieza, and while you're down there, kiss my stinking feet!

Bardock:  Fools!  You're all dead!  He's on his way!!

BarGuy11:  C'mon Bardock!

Bardock:  Fine!  Believe what you want to believe!  But I'm going to try and stop him!

BarGuy12:  Man, what's up with Bardock!

BarGal2:  He lost his crew, that's what!

BarGuy13:  He needs to get to recovery!

Goku:  Bardock!

Bardock:  Who is it?  Show yourself!  Who's calling me?  Come out!  I know you're here!

Goku:  Bardock!

Bardock:  Huh?

Goku:  You know who I am!  Don't you?  Bardock!

Bardock:  Yes, you're my son!

Goku:  It's not too late, Father!  To be different... than him!

Bardock:  Where am I?  This is madness!  Where I was seemed just as real as this!  Frieza!  I've got to stop him!!  It's him!  I can feel it!  I'm the only one who knows!

Commander:  I have given it to you as a gift, Bardock!  So that you could see!  See the horror of your end!  Now you'll know how we felt!

Bardock:  Well, I'm not going to sit around and wait for the show!  I'll stop him, even if I have to do it with my own two hands! (Bardock flies off towards Freeza's ship) Frieza, I'm coming for you, you murderous, self-serving traitor!  It's over!  Torah, Fasha!  This is for you!

Frieza:  What a stunning site!  Sometimes I amaze myself at how callous I can be!

Zarbon:  Sire!

FriezaWorker1:  Lord Frieza!  An intruder is approaching!

(multiple Freeza soldiers start flying down from the ship)

(soldiers simultaneously fire a ki blast at Bardock)

(Bardock flies through the multiple soldiers, killing a few of them in the process)

Bardock:  Come on, you cowards!!

(Bardock launches a blast to free himself and continues flying forward, ramming through multiple soldiers. It then shows the onslaught through a monitor at Freeza's ship.)

Frieza:  It's me he wants, isn't it?  So be it!

Zarbon:  Sire?

Frieza:  Yes, prepare my transport, Zarbon!

Dodoria:  Huh?

Zarbon:  Sire, you wish to leave the ship?

Frieza:  Are you questioning my orders?

Zarbon:  Huh?  No, Lord Frieza!  Right away, Sire!

(a soldier grabs Bardock and the others grabbed him as well)

FriezaFighter1:  Got ya!!

Bardock:  Frieza!  Frieza, come out and fight me!  You coward!  Come out!

(the hatch started to open and Freeza emerges from inside his ship on his bubble car)

FreizaFighter2: It's him!

FriezaFighter3:  Lord Frieza!

FriezaFighter4:  We salute you, Sire!!

FriezaFighter5:  Yeah!  Long live, Lord Frieza!

Bardock:  No way!  You've lived long enough!  Actually, it's been too long for my taste! (Frieza starts charging a Supernova) Frieza, listen up... we quit!  All of us!  Got it!  We don't work for you!  We're free!  You can find someone else to do your dirty work!  Oh, yeah!  There is one last thing! (starts charging up a ki blast) This is for all the people that we killed in your name!  I wish we were never foolish enough to obey you!  Here... have it!  Huh? (hurls his blast at Freeza)

Bardock: (Bardock's blast is seen flying towards Freeza and his growing Supernova and gets swallowed by the tyrant's blast. Freeza starts laughing madly and fires his now massive Supernova directly at Planet Vegeta.) No way!!

FriezaFighter6:  Frieza!  Please don't!

(Bardock gets engulfed by Freeza's Supernova, with many pieces of his armor falling off)

Bardock:  Yes, I... see... now! (thinking) It's you my son!  You are the one who will defeat Frieza!!  Kakarot!!!

(Supernova falls and collides with Planet Vegeta)

(cut to Planet Vegeta getting destroyed)

Frieza:  Oh, my!  This is, stupendous!  Wow!  What a great show!  Unbelievable!!  Look at that!!

(cut to Kakarot inside his space pod)

Bardock:  Kakarot!  My son!  Thank you for helping me!  You were right!  It wasn't too late!  I only wish I would have held you in my arms when I had the chance!  Goodbye, my Son!

(cut to Kakarot rocketing into space)

(cut to kid Vegeta)

Man9:  Prince Vegeta! Do you copy, Sir!

Vegeta:  I'm here!

Man9:  Sir, unfortunate news from Lord Freeza!  Planet Vegeta was struck by a large asteroid today and destroyed!

Vegeta:  And, you're sure?

Man9:  Affirmative, Sir!  Lord Frieza sends his sympathies and regrets!  As of now, you are the only known survivor!

Vegeta:  Oh, really?

Man9:  Would you like to send a reply sir?

Vegeta:  No, no reply.

Man9:  Very well sir, over and out.

(cut to planet Earth with Kakarrot being heard crying...again)

Son Gohan:  Huh?  Oh my goodness, a little boy.  What are you doing way out here little fellow?  Huh?  Whatd'ya know, a tail!  Strange fellow!  Don't worry, I'm a little odd myself!  Believe it or not!  Oh, my!  You are a little stinker, aren't you?  Goodness!  You should take it easy on me!  I'm old enough to be your Grandpa, you know!  Now let's see! (thinking and speaking out) Hmm... hm!  Aahh!  Yes!  I think I know what to call you until I find out where you belong, little fella!  Look, how 'bout I call you Goku! (Kakarot starts laughing) Oh!  You like that, huh?  Alright, then, Goku it is!  Woo hoo!  Goku!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Weee!  What a good little boy!

(credits roll)


Narrator: Planet Vegeta. Many years ago, a small child was born.

[Baby crying]

Narrator: [continues] Unheralded and unattended by its father or mother, the baby cried out, making its lonely plea to the universe. The Saiyans were a people of war, and like all Saiyan babies, the child was destined to fight.

Planthorr: My goodness, that's one loud kid. Yes, he'll be great, watch.

Malaka: That's a bold prediction for the son of a low-class soldier. Let's see ... Bardock's son, huh? Planthorr, I wouldn't stake my reputation on that prediction if I were you.

Planthorr: Hmm ... you just wait.

[Opens chamber baby is in]

Planthorr: Come here, Malaka. Do you hear that?

Malaka: Hmm?

Planthorr: That's the cry of a great warrior. Let's see ... Kakarot. Remember that name.

[On planet Kanassa]

Demetrious: Sir, it's the full moon, just like in the vision.

Kanassan Commander: Yes, Demetrious indeed, it is about to begin. This is the hour for which we have prepared.

Demetrious: Yes, commander.

[Four Great Ape's appear]

[Four Kanassan's attack, to no avail]

[Great Ape Tora disintegrates them with a blast from his mouth]

Kanassan: Don't lose heart, my faithful Kanass. This is our duty. We must see it through until the end.

[Demetrious fires a beam and draws blood from Great Ape Shugesh]

Demetrious: Commander, I have drawn blood. Now the foot must rise and fall.

Kanassan Commander: You have done well, my friend. I will meet you at the door.

[Demetrious then gets stepped on]

[The next day]

Tora: That was a heck of a party, wasn't it?

Fasha: If you say so. I don't remember any of it.

Tora: You're a typical ape, Fasha.

Fasha: Aw, shut up. I don't see how you guys remember anyway. It's elephants that aren't supposed to forget, not apes.

Borgos: I'm with you Fasha. For me it's like waking up from a dream. You kind of remember it all, but then it just slips away.

Shugesh: I don't remember much either, but I remember the crusty little devil that gave me this. [Shugesh rubs scar]

Fasha: Bardock says he remembers everything.

Tora: [Chuckles] Right, don't make me laugh Fasha. Bardock might remember every second of every battle, but he remembers nothing of his personal life. Allow me to demonstrate. Bardock, do you remember what day your son was born?

Bardock: No. But that was a long time ago.

Fasha: It was not you lazy bum. Yesterday? Come on, you need to go see the little tike. You have enough time to stop in before our next assignment.

Bardock: Visit him, huh? How nice. Father-son bonding. Why should I? They'll just send him away.

Fasha: Hm. Bardock. You're a jerk.

Shugesh: Hey guys, why did we fight for this dump anyway, huh? Is Frieza out of his tiny little mind or something?

Bardock: Yeah, but not in this case. I think this planet has special energy or so I've heard.

Tora: Yeah, I heard the same thing. You're supposed to be able to develop physicic powers if you live here. Like being able to read minds, see the future and stuff like that.

Bardock: Frieza's such a paranoid freak. He'd jump at the chance to be able to read minds.

Borgos: That's a scary thought. Frieza really bought his-

[A Kanassan (Toolo) emerges from pile of rubble]

Toolo: I wish you baboons could read minds so you could have heard the thoughts of my troops as you slaughtered them!

[Toolo charges at Bardock, teleports behind him and strikes him on the back of his neck]

[Shugesh strikes Toolo with his knee, and Tora blasts him]

Bardock: What the heck is going on?

Toolo: I have transmuted your destructive force into a more tolerable energy. So you will all die.

Bardock: Yeah? We'll see about that. Goodbye.

Toolo: Wait! You have come here seeking psychic power. Well, I have given it to you, Bardock.

Bardock: He reads minds.

Toolo: You can too now. Bardock, you have the power now too.

Bardock: Me? What are you talking about?

Toolo: The one who seeks the power of Frieza will never have it. But I have given it to you as a gift, Bardock, so that you could see ...

Bardock: See what?

Toolo: See the horror of your end, just like we had to. [Starts laughing]

Bardock: Shut up! [Fires blast at Toolo]

Toolo: Ahhhhhh! [Toolo is disintegrated]

Shugesh: It's dead barbecue. Heh, you never know what you're going to find under a rock these days. Pretty freaky creature eh? Hey. Yo. Hello?

Tora: Stop fooling around Bardock.

[Bardock falls to the ground]

Tora: Hey!

Fasha: Bardock!

Tora: What the heck's going on?

Shugesh: Bardock!

Borgos: He's out cold.

Shugesh: I know that freaky thing had something up his sleeve.

Fasha: Don't you dare die, Bardock.

[On another planet]

[Prince Vegeta is in a room, surrounded by five Saibamen. They try to attack, but he dodges every attack]

Soldier: Did you see that?!

Soldier 2: Yes, I see it all the time. That's Prince Vegeta. He's the best.

Soldier: There's no way!

Soldier 2: Not for any kid you've ever known.

[The Saibamen pounce at Vegeta, who uses an Explosive Wave to scatter them. He then kills them all with Finger Beams.]

Soldier: Unbelievable!

Soldier 2: I told you.

Soldier: My gosh! What's he going to be like when he's full grown?!

Nappa: Nobody really knows that. Yet. But take my advice and stay on his good side.

Soldier: Sure yeah! Gah.

Vegeta: Open up before I-

Soldier: Ah yikes! Sorry sir!

Nappa: [Chuckles] You're the best, Prince.

Vegeta: Stop kissing up, Nappa!

[Traveling on a sort of escalator]

Vegeta: This place bores me! I want another combat assignment!  No more drills!  Man, Frieza!  The day will soon be here that we won't take any more orders from him!  You watch!

Nappa:  Huh?  You think so?

Vegeta:  I know so!

Nappa:  I'd love that!

Zarbon:  Pardon me, Lord Frieza, Sir!  Interesting news!  Planet Kanassa has been occupied as of last night, Sire!

Frieza:  Oh?

Zarbon:  Yes, Sire!  The Kanass have been eradicated. The planet is yours!

Dodoria:  Kanassa!  That job has been in the pool for months!  I thought we'd have to handle that one ourselves!

Zarbon:  No, a band of Saiyans took it!

Frieza:  Saiyans...

Dodoria:  Wow!  Their elite teams are becoming comparable to our own!

Zarbon:  Actually, it was a band of their low-level soldiers!

Dodoria:  No low-levels could take Kanassa!  No!  These are standouts!  The Saiyans are quickly becoming our best fighters!  Am I right?

Zarbon:  Yes, Dodoria!  Without a doubt!  They're much stronger now!  It's amazing!  In a small group on a full moon, they're hard to beat!

Dodoria:  What?  Are you scared of them, Zarbon?

Zarbon:  No, certainly not!  I'm just saying that we need to keep an eye on them, that's all!  Like this Bardock who led the assault on the Kanassans!  What if he and his group teamed up with young Vegeta and a handful of other great fighters!  How would you like to tangle with that bunch on a full moon, Dodoria?

Frieza:  Only a fool would welcome that scenario!

Zarbon: Yes, sire!  Prince Vegeta?  What do you think you're doing?

Dodoria:  Frieza didn't send for you, kid!  You know that no one sees Lord Frieza unless he calls them first!

Vegeta:  Look,  I'm bored!  This is lame!  I need an assignment!

Zarbon:  Hm!  Who do you think you are?  I oughta teach you a lesson in etiquette, Prince!

Frieza:  Give him an assignment Zarbon, immediately!

Zarbon:  Lord Freiza!

Frieza:  The boy doesn't mean any harm, Zarbon!  He just hasn't learned how to control his passion!  Give him the hardest assignment that you have, and Vegeta... do come back alive!

Vegeta:  I will, Sire!  Thank you very much!

Frieza: You don't have to thank me, Vegeta!  You certainly earn your keep around here!  You might want to mind your manners a little better though!

Vegeta:  Sire!

(cut back to Bardock)

Melakka:  If he keeps this up, he's going to be become stronger than King Vegeta!

Planthor:  No kidding!  Bardock, he comes back from every mission half dead!  My gosh!

Melakka:  He's crazy!  What kind of low-level soldier would go to a planet like Kanassa with only a handful of men?

Planthor:  I think he needs to be retested, his case is unusual!

Melakka:  I agree, Planthor!

Torah:  How is he, Melakka?

Melakka:  Let's see here... yes, physically, sure... he's ready!  Mentally, I'm not so sure!  There's a slight change in his brainwave patterns!

Torah:  Brainwaves?

Shugesh:  That doesn't sound to good, Torah!  We'd better handle this one on our own!

Torah:  Right!  We should be okay on Meet!  Well, goodbye, old friend!

Melakka:  Hmmm?  Whoa!

Bardock:  A planet being destroyed!  Was it Vegeta?  No!  It couldn't be!  But wait, the baby, my son... he sees it, too!  It's him... being sent out!  So lonely!  Torah!  I don't understand!  What does my young son have to do with you?  Why am I seeing these things?  It doesn't make sense!  My son, he's become a warrior... but he's different from us!  What happened?  What's wrong with him?  Why am I seeing this!  No... no!

Melakka:  Planthor!  Get him out of there!  Something serious is going on!

Planthor:  Open the hatch, Melakka!  Thank goodness you're alright, you gave us a scare!  Bardock, what happened?

Bardock:  I don't know ... wow!  It was like I was having a nightmare but I wasn't asleep!  At least I don't think I was asleep!

Planthor:  I think it would be wise to take it easy for a while, Bardock!

Bardock:  Oh, yeah?  Well, I wouldn't know, I'm not wise!

Planthor:  You're not?

Bardock:  No!

Planthor:  Oh, I think you're wise!  How else could you take on the assignments that you do and still be alive?

Bardock:  I know how to fight!  That's all!  It doesn't take a whole lot of brains to be a great fighter!  Which reminds me, where's Torah?  I thought I heard him in here earlier!

Planthor:  You and your team were ordered to go to Planet Meet by Frieza himself!

Bardock:  What?  Frieza! So we're finally getting the recognition we deserve!  And those bums take of without me, huh?

Planthor: No!  Wait!  Bardock!  You need to rest!

(Bardock pauses for a brief moment and then cuts to him standing in front of a nursery with Kakarrot crying inside.)

Bardock:  Huh?  Not again!  Oh, thank goodness!  You're real this time!  Man, you sure have some powerful lungs!  Well, look kid, I'll catch you later!

Commander:  Wait!

Bardock:  Huh?

Commander:  You have come here seeking psychic power!!  Well, I have given it to you, Bardock!

Bardock: (sees Kakarrot's plaque) Kakarot, huh?  You see it, too, somehow!  Don't you? (scouter starts beeping) Only an average power level!  I thought you were special! (runs off)

(cut to another planet with Borgos getting killed)

Torah:  Borgos!  No!  Darn you, brutes!  Why?  Tell me!  Why are you doing this?  I don't understand!

Frieza Henchman:  Poor baby!

Dodoria:  What don't you understand, Torah?  That you are weak?  What a mess you are!  Ahh, Torah...  You shouldn't have forgotten that you are weak! (picks him up)

Torah:  What do you mean?  We serve Frieza!  You know that!

Dodoria:  Yes, I know!  Frieza's very impressed with your service record!  Yes, too impressed!  It seems he wants you dead!

Torah:  What?  Why?

Dodoria:  I don't want to flatter you but Frieza thought that you were getting too strong!

Frieza Henchman2:  Cool, huh?  You should consider this a promotion!

Torah:  No!  Look!  It's not fair!  Everything that we've done was for him!  How can he do this?

Dodoria:  You fool!  It's not what you've done!  It's what you might have done in the future!

Torah:  Then no one's safe from Frieza!  Not even you!

Dodoria:  Is that so?

(Dodoria throws Toma in the air and punches him in the jaw before cutting to Bardock arriving at the planet)

Bardock: (sees multiple corpses of the planet's inhabitants)  It looks like they plowed right through this one.  I guess I taught those knuckleheads something about fighting after all!  Yep, still here!  Lousy bums, probably still celebrating! (sees the corpses of his crew) Shugesh, Fasha, Borgos!  What happened?

Torah: (weakly and coughs a few times) B- Bardock!

Bardock:  Torah!  Oh my gosh!  Torah!  Don't tell me you let those Meet-heads do this to you guys!

Torah:  No!  No way, come on!  You should know us better than that, Bardock!

Bardock:  I didn't think so!  Well, what happened then?

Torah:  We... we were ambushed by Dodoria and his men!

Bardock:  Frieza's the one that ordered us here!

Torah:  Yes, it was a set-up.  Frieza, he wants us all dead!

Bardock:  But why?  I mean, after all we've done?  It doesn't make sense!  We took the jobs that even his elites wouldn't mess with and we still won!

Torah:  It's true!  Isn't it!  We were getting to be the best, Frieza's scared!

Bardock:  Scared of what?

Torah:  Of you, Bardock!  Frieza's scared of you!  Don't you see!  He's scared of what you might become!  You're getting too strong!  Good luck, old friend!  I'm sorry that I can't...(closes his eyes and dies)

Bardock:  Goodbye, Torah!  You were my best friend!  So this is what it's come to.  This is how we're rewarded for our hard work!  We tried so hard to please Freeza.  My crew, Borgos, Fasha!  Those pigs!  So they thought we were getting too strong! (removes Toma's handkerchief and his face) Shugesh!  I promise somehow I'll get them for this Shugesh! (starts tying the bloody handkerchief on his forehead) I'll die trying!  Frieza's taken our loyalty, and paid us back in our own blood! (scouter beeps and Bardock turns around) I thought there was a foul smell in the air!  So you're the ones!

Frieza henchman1:  Bardock!  You crack me up!  We had some good laughs with your crew earlier, too!  You should have been there!

Bardock:  You're right!  I should have been there!

Frieza henchman1:  Do you really think that it would have made a difference, Bardock?  I mean really!

Frieza henchman2: (Frieza henchman2 fires a bunch of ki blasts at Bardock)There, that should do it! (scouter beeps as Bardock appears above him) Hm? (Bardock hits him hard on the skull)  Ahhh!! (starts falling to the ground)

Frieza henchman1:  Ahh!  What the? (he and his comrades fire a ki blast at Bardock, who vanishes before all three blasts connects)  Where the heck did he go?

Frieza henchman3:  He can't hide forever!  Huh?

Frieza henchman1:  Huh, Bardock?  Huh?  What?  Ahh!  There you are!  Die you fool! (fires a ki blast through the smoke, accidentally shooting down his teammate)  Huh?  Oh, no!  What have I done?  Darn it!

Frieza henchman4:  Ingenious move, he's no slouch!  Better watch out!

Frieza henchman5:  Me watch out!  He's just a low level, we're the low-level, we're the elites!  Now let's go (both of them starts charging at Bardock)

(Bardock starts having another vision)

Goku: (through vision) Kaio-Ken Attack!  Aaahh!

(Barock gets kneed in the face)

(Frieza henchman4 grabs Bardock from behind as Frieza henchman5 proceeds to punch him in the stomach. Bardock starts having another vision.)

Vegeta: Not bad, Kakarot!  For a low level! (pounds him to fall to the ground)

(Bardock thinking as he's getting pummeled in reality)

(Bardock manages to flip over, causing Frieza henchman4 to get in the way of the attack)

(Frieza henchman4 gets punched in the back by Mango, coughing up blood)

(Badrock breaks free and fires a ki blast)

(both he and Frieza henchman4 scream as they get disintegrated by the blast)

Bardock:  That was from my crew to you!  So those were some of Frieza's elites!  I can see why he might be worried! Now what? (scouter starts beeping) (turns to see Dodoria)

Dodoria:  Mmm!  Unfortunate business isn't it, Bardock?

Bardock:  Darn right!  Unfortunate for you, Dodoria!  Torah told me that you're behind this!

Dodoria:  That blew him away!  Bardock, you should have remembered your place!

Someone who didn't even show up on the captions:  Commander Dodoria!  A message from Lord Frieza, sir!

Dodoria:  Oh?(charging up a Mouth Energy Wave)

(Bardock screams as he gets engulfed by the blast)

Someone who didn't even show up on the captions:  Lord Frieza has requested that you rendez-vous with his ship before it reaches Vegeta, sir!

Dodoria:  Frieza... planning something delicious no doubt!

Bardock: (muffled while under his teammates' bodies) (frees himself from under the pile and starts coughing) I'll get them... somehow, someway!  For you guys.  You weren't low-level soldiers!  You were stronger than most of their elites!  We'll meet again, my friends!  Sooner or later, we'll meet again!

(cut to Kakarrot inside a space pod)

Man3:  Hey, we've got one to go here!  Coordinate FX-50, his name is Kakarot!

Man4:  Kakarot, huh?  And which planet are they sending you to, little guy!  Let's see, Eeee Arth!

Man3:  Eeee Arth?

Man4:  Look Kakarot, we don't name 'em, we just send you there, little buddy!

Man3:  This pod is a go, let's move him out!

(cut to Freeza's ship)

Dodoria:  Mission accomplished, Sire!

Frieza:  Oh, really?  You sound so sure of yourself, Dodoria!

Zarbon:  Once again, you botched it up!

Dodoria:  I did not!

Zarbon:  You missed one, the leader.  Bardock!  He's still alive!

Dodoria:  You're wrong, I saw him die!

Zarbon:  Oh?  Then what's that there?

(Bardock's space pod is seen flying by Freeza's ship)

Dodoria:  Huh?  A Saiyan space-pod!  I don't believe it!  How could he have survived that?

Frieza:  Dodoria!  Perhaps this will teach you not to take things for granted!  To be more thorough with your work!

Dodoria: (stammers a few times before speaking) Lord Frieza, forgive me.  Please, Sire!  Let me go now!  Bardock, he's dead!  I'll be...

Frieza:  You'll be quite, Dodoria!  You're not going anywhere!  There's no need to chase after the bee anymore, I've decided to go straight for the hive!

Dodoria:  Sire?

Zarbon:  Yes, I see!  You've decided to extinguish the whole lot of them, Sire!

Frieza:  That's right!  You guessed it Zarbon!  If you want to get rid of weeds for good, you have to get them by the root!

Bardock:  Great, Frieza!  Aw, man... not good! (thinking) He's coming to Vegeta, I know he is!  I can feel it!  How bizarre!  It's as clear as day!  I can go inside of his mind!

(cut to Frieza)

Frieza:  Ah, yes!  Ease up!  There she is!  Beautiful, isn't she?  A rare gem indeed, as red as a blood ruby!

(cut to Kakarot's space pod closing on the launching platform)

Man5:  Stand clear of door seven!  Launching sequence has been initiated!

(Kakarot's space pod is seen flying by Bardock's space pod)

Bardock:   It's happening again!  Kakarot! (through vision sees Goku switching to child mode, switching to teen mode, and switching to adult form]

(cut to Kakarot's space pod rocketing into space)

(cut to Bardock's spacepod landing on the landing deck)

Man6:  Please clear the landing deck!  Pod landing in four seconds!  Three... two.. one...

(cut to Bardock coming out from his space pod laying on it)

Man7:  Bardock?  Hey, are you alright!

Bardock:  Yeah!  Please!  I need to go!  Move!

Man8:  You need to go straight to recovery, oh and hey!  You missed your son!  He just left!

Bardock:  Huh?  Just now?

Man8:  Yep!  He left just before you arrived, Sir!  Darn shame!  Yeah!  You only missed him by a matter of seconds!  I wish I would have known that it was you coming in, I could have delayed his departure!

Bardock:  Then it's true, all true!  I wasn't hallucinating!  My son, that planet!

Man8:  Are you okay, Sir!  Please!  You're injured!  Allow us to escort you to the recovery chambers!

Bardock:  That means that the other part of the vision must be true as well!  Vegeta!

Man8:  I'd be happy to accompany you sir!

Man7:  Oh my gosh, take a look at this would ya!  They really messed him up good this time!

Bardock:  That monster!  He's going to blow up the whole planet!  I've got to warn the others!  I've got to stop him somehow!

Commander:  The one who seeks the power, Frieza, will never have it!  But I have given it to you as a gift, Bardock!  So that you could see!  See the horror of your end, just like we had to!

Bardock:  Where am I?

Commander:  This is the future, Bardock!  This is what you killed my people for, isn't it?

Bardock:  My son?

Commander:  Yes, your son!  He's growing up to be a powerful warrior just like his father was!

Bardock:  Was?

Commander:  At this time you are long since dead!  You blow up with your planet!

Bardock:  No, Frieza!!

Commander:  Take heart, Bardock!  A savior has been born!  One who has the power to save the innocent from people like Frieza... and you!

Bardock:  NO!  I'm not going crazy!  It is the future!  I've got to let the others know!  If I'm able to see the future, there might be a chance to change it!

[a little note about "BarGuy" characters in the next scene.  Although I have at least thirteen "BarGuy"s, I know that some of those lines belong to the same characters.  However, I could not successfully match up the voices, so each line gets a new speaker, unless I actually see the speaker (6,7 only).  I will correct this little problem soon!]

(cut to a bar with many Saiyans socializing as Steppenwolf's "Bad to the Bone" plays in a radio)

BarGuy1:  So, whatd'ya say?

BarGal1:  You dog!

BarGuy2:  Whoa!

(cut to Bardock entering inside from a door then falling on a table on the right side of him)

BarGuy3:  Bardock!  What's wrong?

BarGuy4:  He got his butt kicked, that's what's wrong!

BarGuy5:  It's about time!

Bardock:  Listen, everybody!  It's Frieza!  He's coming for us!

BarGuy6:  Us?

BarGuy7:  You mean you, right?

Bardock:  No us!  You, me, everyone here!  It's true!  He's scared of us!  He wants us all dead!  My whole crew is dead thanks to that freak!

BarGuy8:  Bardock gets his tail whipped and it's the end of the world, right?  Maybe you goons should stop pretending to be elites! (Saiyan crowd starts laughing)

BarGuy6:  No kidding, Bardock!  Welcome to the real world, buddy-boy!

BarGuy7:  It hurts!  Don't it?

BarGuy9:  Let's tell him that we'll leave him alone if he bows down whenever he's in the presence of a Saiyan!

BarGuy10:  No, forget it!  That little worm is going to have to kiss my stinky feet!

Bardock:  Fools, you're dead!

BarGuy6:  Bow down in front of me Frieza, and while you're down there, kiss my stinking feet!

Bardock:  Fools!  You're all dead!  He's on his way!!

BarGuy11:  C'mon Bardock!

Bardock:  Fine!  Believe what you want to believe!  But I'm going to try and stop him!

BarGuy12:  Man, what's up with Bardock!

BarGal2:  He lost his crew, that's what!

BarGuy13:  He needs to get to recovery!

Goku:  Bardock!

Bardock:  Who is it?  Show yourself!  Who's calling me?  Come out!  I know you're here!

Goku:  Bardock!

Bardock:  Huh?

Goku:  You know who I am!  Don't you?  Bardock!

Bardock:  Yes, you're my son!

Goku:  It's not too late, Father!  To be different... than him!

Bardock:  Where am I?  This is madness!  Where I was seemed just as real as this!  Frieza!  I've got to stop him!!  It's him!  I can feel it!  I'm the only one who knows!

Commander:  I have given it to you as a gift, Bardock!  So that you could see!  See the horror of your end!  Now you'll know how we felt!

Bardock:  Well, I'm not going to sit around and wait for the show!  I'll stop him, even if I have to do it with my own two hands! (Bardock flies off towards Freeza's ship) Frieza, I'm coming for you, you murderous, self-serving traitor!  It's over!  Torah, Fasha!  This is for you!

Frieza:  What a stunning site!  Sometimes I amaze myself at how callous I can be!

Zarbon:  Sire!

FriezaWorker1:  Lord Frieza!  An intruder is approaching!

(multiple Freeza soldiers start flying down from the ship)

(soldiers simultaneously fire a ki blast at Bardock)

(Bardock flies through the multiple soldiers, killing a few of them in the process)

Bardock:  Come on, you cowards!!

(Bardock launches a blast to free himself and continues flying forward, ramming through multiple soldiers. It then shows the onslaught through a monitor at Freeza's ship.)

Frieza:  It's me he wants, isn't it?  So be it!

Zarbon:  Sire?

Frieza:  Yes, prepare my transport, Zarbon!

Dodoria:  Huh?

Zarbon:  Sire, you wish to leave the ship?

Frieza:  Are you questioning my orders?

Zarbon:  Huh?  No, Lord Frieza!  Right away, Sire!

(a soldier grabs Bardock and the others grabbed him as well)

FriezaFighter1:  Got ya!!

Bardock:  Frieza!  Frieza, come out and fight me!  You coward!  Come out!

(the hatch started to open and Freeza emerges from inside his ship on his bubble car)

FreizaFighter2: It's him!

FriezaFighter3:  Lord Frieza!

FriezaFighter4:  We salute you, Sire!!

FriezaFighter5:  Yeah!  Long live, Lord Frieza!

Bardock:  No way!  You've lived long enough!  Actually, it's been too long for my taste! (Frieza starts charging a Supernova) Frieza, listen up... we quit!  All of us!  Got it!  We don't work for you!  We're free!  You can find someone else to do your dirty work!  Oh, yeah!  There is one last thing! (starts charging up a ki blast) This is for all the people that we killed in your name!  I wish we were never foolish enough to obey you!  Here... have it!  Huh? (hurls his blast at Freeza)

Bardock: (Bardock's blast is seen flying towards Freeza and his growing Supernova and gets swallowed by the tyrant's blast. Freeza starts laughing madly and fires his now massive Supernova directly at Planet Vegeta.) No way!!

FriezaFighter6:  Frieza!  Please don't!

(Bardock gets engulfed by Freeza's Supernova, with many pieces of his armor falling off)

Bardock:  Yes, I... see... now! (thinking) It's you my son!  You are the one who will defeat Frieza!!  Kakarot!!!

(Supernova falls and collides with Planet Vegeta)

(cut to Planet Vegeta getting destroyed)

Frieza:  Oh, my!  This is, stupendous!  Wow!  What a great show!  Unbelievable!!  Look at that!!

(cut to Kakarot inside his space pod)

Bardock:  Kakarot!  My son!  Thank you for helping me!  You were right!  It wasn't too late!  I only wish I would have held you in my arms when I had the chance!  Goodbye, my Son!

(cut to Kakarot rocketing into space)

(cut to kid Vegeta)

Man9:  Prince Vegeta! Do you copy, Sir!

Vegeta:  I'm here!

Man9:  Sir, unfortunate news from Lord Freeza!  Planet Vegeta was struck by a large asteroid today and destroyed!

Vegeta:  And, you're sure?

Man9:  Affirmative, Sir!  Lord Frieza sends his sympathies and regrets!  As of now, you are the only known survivor!

Vegeta:  Oh, really?

Man9:  Would you like to send a reply sir?

Vegeta:  No, no reply.

Man9:  Very well sir, over and out.

(cut to planet Earth with Kakarrot being heard crying...again)

Son Gohan:  Huh?  Oh my goodness, a little boy.  What are you doing way out here little fellow?  Huh?  Whatd'ya know, a tail!  Strange fellow!  Don't worry, I'm a little odd myself!  Believe it or not!  Oh, my!  You are a little stinker, aren't you?  Goodness!  You should take it easy on me!  I'm old enough to be your Grandpa, you know!  Now let's see! (thinking and speaking out) Hmm... hm!  Aahh!  Yes!  I think I know what to call you until I find out where you belong, little fella!  Look, how 'bout I call you Goku! (Kakarot starts laughing) Oh!  You like that, huh?  Alright, then, Goku it is!  Woo hoo!  Goku!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Weee!  What a good little boy!

(credits roll)


[opening]

Narrator: Five years have passed since Goku and his friends thwarted the evil King Piccolo's plans for global conquest. Thanks to their heroic efforts, the shadow of doom was lifted from the world, and a new day of hope has dawned. For in the years since Piccolo's defeat, it has been a time of rebuilding, healing, prosperity, and peace for the citizens of Earth...but unknown to them, at this very moment, a new threat to humankind is hurdling through the solar system. And as the mysterious invader makes it's final approach to Earth, one thing is certain... The peaceful era the human race has enjoyed for the last five years is about to come crashing to an end...

[Chi-Chi is heard calling Gohan.]

Chi-Chi:: Gohan! Gohan? It's time to come in. Gohan!
(Goku jumps on the trees)

Goku: This one outta do. (he growls, and he knocks down a tree with his punch)
Chi-Chi: Hey Gohan! Goku, you think you've got enough firewood there?
Goku: (drops the tree bark) Yeah, this should last us a while, don't you think?
Chi-Chi: You're going to hurt yourself one of these days.
Goku: Uh, I'm fine. Where's Gohan?
Chi-Chi: I don't know, but I think you better go find him don't you? You two are suppose to be at Master Roshi pretty soon.
Goku: Oh yeah, that's right.
Chi-Chi: You better take the Flying Nimbus. You don't want to be late for your reunion.
Goku: Okay. (walks off.)Bye, Chi-Chi!
Chi-Chi: Goku, be careful. Oh, I'm going to worry myself to death.
(next scene, we see pink flamingos in a farm, we see a farmer raking.)

Farmer: This job's bigger than I thought. (a pod on the sky is about to fall) What is that? (gets frightened, as his cigarettes drop, as the pod is about to land on the ground as the farmer gets scared, the pod explodes, the farmer groans as his chickens run away.) My gosh, ah yeah, it is, I better go... check it out. Aaaaaaah... Goodness, why me? (he drives his truck and he sees the pod, and he stops.) I better burn my pea shooter. Ugh... aaah... I don't like this. That's no meteor, it's made of steel. What in the world? I'll be darn!
(A farmer sees Raditz come out of a strange pod.)

Raditz: So, the creatures on this planet are still alive. Kakarot has failed us.
Farmer: (holding his shotgun) You're on my property.
Raditz: Is that so? (Raditz checks his scouter) Hmm...your power level is puny. Ha. Level five.
Farmer: Don't you come any closer! Look, I'll use this thing! (the farmer fires his gun) Ahhh!!! Huh?
Raditz: (Raditz catches the bullet) Hmmm...
Farmer: (he screams, as Raditz flicks the bullet right at the farmer, sending him hurling backward and killing him)
Raditz: Heh. What a fragile breed of people. (scouter beeps) I'm picking up a higher power level from over there It must be him! (flies off) Prepare yourself, Kakarot!
(In the forest, we see Gohan lost in the woods, whimpering.)

Gohan: I want my daddy. I wanna go home. (sticks a monkey tail) Daddy!! Daddy!! Uh, anyone? (he begins crying as he walks around in the woods, then he sits in front of the tree stomp, then he sees the mysterious bright light, as the butterfly meets Gohan)Hey Mr. Butterfly!(it flies off) Wait, come back! I'm not gonna hurt you, I just want to look. (butterfly lands on a tree stump.) Aw, come on. You want me to climb up there? Okay! Hmm... (he runs to a tree bark as he jumps) Aaaah! (lands on the bark) Aw... Hold on. (jumps back on the bark)I'm coming. (loses his grip) Say, are you sure there's not an elevator on this thing?
(In the forest, Gohan walks out of the forest.)

Gohan: Uh, hello? Mis- Mister Butterfly? (the bush shakes) Uh. (a jaguar scares Gohan.) AAAAH!
Jaguar: Ahhhhh. Hehehehehe...
Gohan: Nice, kitty. Uhhhh.
Jaguar: Ahhhhhhh.
Gohan: Uhhhh... I know, play dead. (he faints as the jaguar holds Gohan, he licks him as Gohan giggles, he roars, and takes his hat off) Uh... My hat is gone! (starts crying) No! My daddy gave me that hat! (runs off crying, as the jaguar growls, see Gohan crying) My hat! Gaaaaaah! (the jaguar freaks out and runs off with Gohan's hat. Gohan chases him, so he can get back his hat) Give me back my hat! You can't have it! (the jaguar freaks out when Gohan continues running towards him through the bushes, they jump over a rock, the jaguar runs away, as Gohan runs through the bushes, and he falls through a cliff, and he takes a nap)
(The Scene Is Gohan Gets Stuck on a Tree)

Gohan: Whoa. (he walks off, with Goku in the woods)
Goku: Hey, Gohan!!
Gohan: Okay. (he jumps on the two rocks when he is about to lose his balance, now he did it)Mommy! Daddy! (Gohan walks on the river so sad, as he sees a blue bird) Oh well, hello there! You're a pretty bird. (jumps off as he walks on a log as it tumbles)It's nice to meet you. (bird chirps) So, do you have a name? I'm Gohan. (bird flies away) Hey wait! (the log tumbles as it knocks Gohan off it sending him to the water, as he starts to get on the log, losing his grip) Mommy! Daddy! Help me!
Goku: Huh? (he sees Gohan's hat that the jaguar is wearing) Hey you! That hat. (jaguar gets scared) That's Gohan's! It belongs to my son. Have you seen it? (the jaguar growls growls) Where did you get his hat? (jaguar growls again) I said, where did you get it!? (Gohan's hat drops as the jaguar runs off, and the next scene is Gohan is still stuck in a waterfall,the log hits the rock making Gohan drown in the water, when he gets back on the slippery log, as he rises to the waterfall again)
Gohan: Ah, help me!! (we see Goku riding on a cloud finding Gohan)
Goku: Gohan!
Gohan: Mommy! Daddy!
Goku: (sees Gohan) Gohan!
Gohan: (screaming)
Goku: Gohan, can you hear me? (still riding on a cloud) Gohan!?
Gohan: (still stuck on a river with a log) Aaaaaaah!
Goku: Gohan!
Gohan: It's daddy! (lost his grip again, as he grabs on the end of a log)
Goku: Hang on son,I'll be right there! (he gets close to Gohan when he is about to catch him) Just a little farther! Huh? (Gohan gets in the waterfall cave)
Gohan: Daddy!
Goku: Hang on, Gohan! (Goku flies up on a cliff)
Gohan: Heeeeelp! (Goku rides still on a cloud searching for his son, Gohan is still stuck) Daddy! Hurry! It's dark... huh? (he sees the escape tunnel, as he falls through the waterfall) AAAAAAAAAAAH!!! Daddy! Help!
Goku: Uh! (the log falls down) Gohan! Gohan! (Goku hears Gohan crying as he lands on a tree branch)
Gohan: Heeeeeelp! I'm stuck!I can't get down! (Goku sees Gohan) Aaaaaah! Huh? (walks and hugs Goku) Waaaaah! Daddy! Thank you, daddy! Oh! I was so scared!
Goku: But, how did you get up here? Well, that's strange.
Gohan: Daddy. I lost my hat. (Goku puts his son's hat back on)
Goku: What? Silly, no you didn't, it's on your head. Now, let's go and get you cleaned up, then you can come with me to meet all my friends at Master Roshi's.
Gohan: Ah!
Goku: That's my boy!
(Raditz flies at the city around with the people, with the boy and his father laughing, the train makes sound with Raditz flying)

Raditz: Ah, miserable little vermin!
(Piccolo stands on a cliff sensing Raditz)

Piccolo: (Piccolo senses Raditz) Uh? Huh? Huh? What is that? I've never felt so much power! Uh...huh...? It can't be Goku, it's too horrible. Huh! Who is that!? (Raditz lands in front of Piccolo)
Raditz: Excuse me for dropping in. I'm trying ta find a man named Kakarot. I thought you were him.
Piccolo: Well you thought wrong. Now turn around and get outta here before I get angry.
Raditz: Someone's having a bad day...
Piccolo: Believe me, you have no idea. Now get lost!
Raditz: [laughing] Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you? (Raditz checks his scouter) Power level three hundred and twenty two. I can tell you're not from this planet, but you'd be a fool to attack me...with such an insufficient power. [laughs]
Piccolo: Now, listen to me. You came here. I have no intention of starting a fight.
Raditz: I do.
Piccolo: [growls] Alright, if that's the way he wants it! (Piccolo blasts Raditz) Ha ha. Huh? (Raditz is unscathed)
Raditz: [he laughs] Impressive. You actually managed to singe some of my leg hair.
Piccolo: Uh!?
Raditz: But allow me to demonstrate a more effective attack.
Piccolo: Huh... huh!?
Raditz: It's one of my favorites. I call it a double sunday. Now, see if you can follow this one. (Raditz' scouter indicates another power level) Uh? Well, I guess it's your lucky day green man. (Raditz leaves as the scouter beeps, then he talks to himself) There it is. Just on the edge of my scouter's range. And it's big. It must be the largest power level on this planet. It's Kakarot. This time I'm sure.
Piccolo: (to himself, while breathing hard) I don't believe it. I hit him full force and he didn't even flinch. This guy could be a problem.
(In the sky, Raditz is flying as his scouter beeps)

Raditz: (to himself) Have you forgotten your pride Kakarot. We are Saiyans, the mightiest warriors in the universe. I can still remember the day that we first sent you to this planet as an infant. We had high hopes for you then Kakarot, why have you not carried out your mission? Kakarot!
Narrator: Who is this mysterious Saiyan warrior that now darkens the sky with his presence? His search for the one name Kakarot has already lead into Piccolo, one of the most powerful fighters on Earth. Could it lead him to Goku as well? The answers to this burning questions will soon be revealed, and Goku will discover the secrets of his pasts. Next time on Dragon Ball Z!

[ending and credits]


[A Legend Revealed appears]

[This scene starts with a defeated Recoome, as Goku looks at Jeice and Burter]

Goku: You two! I'm warning you, leave this planet now and don't ever come back! I don't want to fight you, but I will if I have to! And if it comes to that, I promise you that you'll be joining your friend here on the ground! Understand me!?

Jeice: [snickers] Oy! Did you hear that, Burter? This guy gives him one lucky punch and he thinks he can take on the Ginyu force.

Burter: Yeah, Jeice. I think he must have hit himself in the head pretty hard when he land it here. He got Recoome by surprise. That's all. That doesn't make him tough. Just lucky. Right?

Jeice: Right. I'm surprise he got a punch in it all. This guy's power level is way to pathetic to be a challenge.

Krillin: Man. I don't like this at all. We'd better get ready Gohan.

Gohan: Right. Come on dad.

[wind blows]

Jeice: Hm.

Burter: Yeah.

[they get ready to jump on to another rubble and faces Goku]

Jeice: NOW! SAY HELLO TO THE GINYU FORCE! [he poses] JEICE!

Burter: [poses] I am your worst nightmare! Prepare your self for [poses again] Burter!

Goku: You wanna dance, or fight.

Vegeta: Do it, Kakarot.

[Burter and Jeice jumps to the rubble]

Jeice: Ready?

Burter: Set...

Jeice: [dashes] GO!

[Burter dashes and gets to Goku and continues dashing]

Burter: Over here.

[they continue dashing at Goku over and over]

Jeice: Burter!

Burter: What!?

Jeice: What's the deal with this guy? He won't even make a move!

Burter: I don't know, Jeice. I guess he's scared stiff.

Jeice: Gotcha! I bet the poor guy's shaking in his boots!

Krillin: Man, I don't understand this! Is Goku just gonna stand there and leave himself open for their attack.

Burter: Hey! Yo! Jeice! This guy's a city duck. Go ahead and put it to him.

Jeice: Right. You take the lead, Burter and I'll be right behind you.

[Burter shocked starts to land on the ground and uses a blue energy ball and is deflected and hits the rubble, Jeice uses ki blasts at Goku with no effect]

Krillin: GOKU! NO!

[he and Gohan dodge the blasts, Vegeta shocked, Goku had no effect on Burter and Jeice's attack]

Vegeta: [thinks] Incredible. If I wasn't seeing this with my own eyes.

Jeice: I've had enough of this! Think it's time to throw some pain in the baby.

[they land on the ground facing Goku]

Jeice: I'm sick of your little games. We are the Gin-

[Goku punches Jeice in the face, he screams, and Burter freaks out, he starts crying]

Jeice: [furious] How dare you.

Goku: [surprised] How dare I what? Weren't the two you were just trying to attack me?

Jeice: Why...you...I'll...I'LL DESTROY YOU!!!

[They attack as Goku blocks their attack and he kicks them]

Jeice: He's-

Burter: Dead meat!

[Goku starts screaming and pushes Jeice and Burter away]

Jeice: There's no way! Where did he get that power!?

Krillin: He just channeled his power into some sort of blast!

[outside of Namek, the mountain explodes with Frieza riding on a hoverboard and laughs]

Frieza: They are dastardly those foolish Namekians. Do they truly think they can outsmart the great Frieza? Well, we'll just see about that. This little snag has only postponed the inevitable. Very soon, I'll meet the secret to using the dragon balls out of one of those green pest. And then nothing to stop me from making my wish! [laughs maniacally]

[End of Act 1]

Act 2
[on Guru's house, with Guru sleeping]

Dende: Oh, Guru. It's been quite a while since Nail left. I wonder what's going on. I feel so helpless. [looks at the window] Please, Nail. We need our help. Hurry.

[ouside of Namek]

Captain Ginyu: Gentlemen, you can't make it as a Ginyu on brute strength alone! A Ginyu must be able to show cases grand your fabulous strength and variety of poses! NOW! [they freak out] IT'S YOUR TURN! I WANNA SEE YOU MEN STRIKE A POSE!! WATCH!! Captain Ginyu! Got it? You look like a much a hood ornaments the purpose of striking of posers. Not to become a wallpaper! That's why we chant loudly when we pose to draw attention to our magnificence. I know. I'll just have to raise a states a little bit. [takes out a candy] The best poser gets a candy. No do it! Let's go! Ginyu!

Struck: Struck here.

Captain Stroll: Captain Stroll!

Goose: Goose.

Foggers: Foggers.

Captain Giynu: Sound off!

Together: now feel the power of...

Captain Ginyu: The Ginyu Force.

[they get freaked out]

Captain Ginyu: So, you're a Captain, too?

[punches Captain Stroll away]

Captain Ginyu: There's only one captain of the Ginyu Force, and that's me!

[soldier touches the dragon ball with his feet]

Captain Ginyu: IDIOT! YOU TOUCHED THE DRAGON BALL! Didn't I specifically say before starting this Triant. Not to touch any of the dragon balls! Well, didn't I!?

[grabs Triant]

Triant: Yes.

Captain Ginyu: Did you?

Triant: Well, uh. Yes.

Captain Ginyu: Okaay

[throws Triant away]

Captain Ginyu: Congratulations, gentlemen! You managed to survived the first cut. But...

[points the Dragon Balls]

Captain Ginyu: I'm afraid tryouts are over. You're all tough guys that's true. But, you lacked a one thing that's all Ginyu's a part. [giggles] Style. [laughing] Oh and gentlemen. One more thing. Run for your lives.

[they run away and Ginyu punches a men and another men and another men]

Captain Ginyu: Don't feel ashamed men. I gave the same farewell cargo to everyone who tries out for the Ginyu Force and doesn't make it. And remember... [throws Goose away] Style! [punches Froggers away, and laughs]

[scene starts with Jeice and Burter frustrated with Goku, with the wind blows, they start to fight with Goku as Jeice freaks out and stops lunging and jumps, and Burter stops lunging and jumps to the rubble]

Jeice: [about Goku] What is it with this guy? Burter and I are coming at him from every angle, but he's not dodging. Not even lifting a finger. He's really pissing me off.

[Vegeta Growls]

Gohan: You know, Krillin. I just don't think these guys are powerful as we thought they were. My dad hasn't even fought back.

Krillin: I'm not so sure.

[pause]

Jeice: No one ignores me like that. No one!

[he yells and lunges at Goku and punches him but no effect on him, so as Burter's punches]

Krillin: No way. They can't even touch him. His speed is incredible I hardly see him moving! Those two guys! They're about to find out how powerful Goku is the hard way.

Gohan: I. I don't know. Two against one and they're both so strong.

[they fly up]

Jeice: [checks Goku's power level] I don't understand. His power level's only five thousand. I'm sure of it. But my attacks don't even faze him.

Vegeta: It's obvious that Kakarot does raising his power level so quickly they aren't able to detect it. He's not even breaking a sweat. It's unbelievable. How did he become so strong, so fast?

[Jeice keeps checking Goku's power level]

Vegeta; Those scouters won't help them. Even if they knew his power level they still wouldn't be able to stop him. But where did his powers come from? I must know! But there's a way to become a Super Saiyan. I must find it out!

Burter: That punk! No one makes a fool of Burter and lived to tell about it! [to Jeice] Hey Jeice! It's time for the Purple Spiral Flash!

Jeice: The Purple Spiral Flash, huh? Good idea. Right Burter, let's do it! Now!

Burter: Right.

[he powers up and Jeice also powers up and they spin using the purple spiral blasting beams at Goku, he starts yelling, continuous beam attacks start shooting the ground]

Jeice: What's happening!?

[to the cliffs]

Bulma; I've had it! [takes off the headphones] What do they think they're doing me leaving me here alone like this!? It's inexcusable! This is not how to treat a lady! This place is ruining my complexion! The first thing they're gonna do to get back is take me home! Don't they have any idea how weak and defenseless I am? I'm too delecate for this! [pause] I missed her.

[hears a comet and it starts hitting Bulma and the rocks with the TV ruined and her stuff ruined, and Bulma gets out of the rocks]

Bulma: SOMEBODY GET ME OUT OF HERE!!!

[scene starts with Burter furious, and Jeice also angry]

Jeice: We didn't even touch him!

Burter: [calling Jeice] Jeice, come in! Jeice! Do you here me?

Jeice: Yeah Burter, I got you!

Burter: I got a new plan! Use the fire Crusher Ball. Right? When you fire it, I'm sure he'll jump out of the way to evade it.

Jeice: That's your plan?

Burter: I wasn't through! When he jumps, I'll sneak in and crash him from behind. He might be fast, but I'm the fastest warrior in the universe.

Jeice: Gotcha, mate. [to Goku] This is what you get for messing with the Ginyu. [powers up] CRUSHER...

[yellow ball comes out of his hand]

Jeice: BAALLLLLL!!!!

[the ball grows big as he throws]

Burter: Dodge you punk!

[the Crusher Ball is about to hit Goku]

Burter: Jump now! What are you doing!?

[Goku deflects the Crusher Ball with Jeice, Burter, Gohan, Krillin, and Vegeta freak out]

Jeice: He deflected it!!

[the Crusher Ball is bout to hit Burter and he dodges it]

Burter: [upset] DAMN YOU!! [lunges at Goku and Goku disappears] Help?

[he looks around as Jeice freaks out]

Burter: Hey, where did he go?

Jeice: Look out behind you!

[Goku is behind Burter]

Burter: [screams]

Jeice: [freaks out]

Burter: [screaming] Be merciful.

Goku: Hi.

Narrator: Goku certainly seems to have the upper hand. But the battle has only just begun. Could Vegeta be right? Has Goku through training and sheer will become a thing of legend? A Super Saiyan? Find out next time on Dragon Ball Z!

End of Act 2


[The music Reminded by Drowning Pool plays]

Bardock: Frieza! I'm coming for you, you murderous self-serving traitor! It's over!

Frieza's soldiers: All hail, Lord Frieza!

Bardock: [Chuckling] No way, Frieza. You lived long enough! Actually it's been too long far for my taste. Frieza, listen up! We quit! All of us! Got it!? We don't work for you anymore! We're free! You can find someone else to do your dirty work! Oh yeah! [Chuckling] There's one last thing... [Charges a Final Spirit Cannon]

Narrator: Deployed on a routine military operation, the Saiyan baby Kakarot flies toward Earth, missing the deadly surprise attack on his home planet. His father Bardock confronts the assailants, Frieza and his entire army, alone.

Bardock: This is for all the people we killed in your name! Here, have it! [launches a Final Spirit Cannon]

Frieza: [Evil Laughter]

[uses his Death Ball, as the Final Spirit Cannon has no effect on the Death Ball]

Bardock: No way!

[Everyone screams, as Bardock gets hit by the Death Ball, causing his armor to disintegrate; inside a nearby spaceship, Cooler and his henchmen watch Bardock's death]

Dore: That's the guy right there, Bardock.

Salza: He doesn't look so frightening to me. Anyway, he's space dust now. And there goes the whole monkey farm. Now, this is light entertainment. [Salza notices Goku in his space pod.]

Hm? What's this? Someone's getting away! Magnify the image!

Neiz: Right, I'm on it Salza!

Salza: I want an interior view as well!

Neiz: That's it, got it.

Salza: Where does he think he's going?!

Neiz: It looks like he's heading towards a planet called Earth! Intercept course?

Salza: Yes.

Cooler: Belay that order.

Doore: Sire!

Neiz: Yes sir!

Salza: But.. someone is escaping!

Cooler: Frieza is the one in charge of this quadrant, let him clean up his own mess. I've got seven planets to destroy by the end of the day. Why should I allow myself to get behind schedule just to cover his mistake?

Besides, he's just a Saiyan child. He's no threat to us. [Cooler stares at Frieza laughing on the monitor.]

Ah, look at him! What foolishness! He's so pleased with that himself he's blinded by his arrogant pride! That could be King Vegeta on that space pod for all he knows!

You've got a lot to learn, brother. Let's get out of here!

[Opening]

[at Roshi's Island, Goku trains and launches Kamehameha on the water]

Master Roshi: Look at that! I can see clear to the main land, Goku! That's amazing!

Goku: Awesome huh? Watch this. I can make the walls go higher!

Master Roshi (thinking to himself): Remarkable. He's never trained harder, but he's so relaxed and talkative about it. Beating Frieza changed him.

[[[Goku's House]]]

Gohan: [Doing work] There... divide that by 10...

Chi-Chi: Hi! I thought my little scholar might be thirsty. Here's some tea. [Notices Icarus in window] Hm? Hey! What do think you're doing? I know what you're up to. Now you get out of here.

Goku: Icarus, leave Gohan alone, he's trying to finish his homework.

Chi-Chi: What? Did you hear what your father just said? He told Icarus to leave you alone because you were doing your... homework. Goku? Are you feeling ok, honey?

Goku: Oh yeah, I'm feeling just fine.

Chi-Chi: Are you sure you don't have a fever, Goku? You sound a little strange.

Goku: No, I feel great. I just want Gohan to finish his homework.

Chi-Chi: Yep, I knew it, I knew it. Goku has never cared if you finish your homework. Gohan, I'm afraid there's something seriously wrong with your father. I wonder if all this fighting has finally knocked a few screws loose in Goku's head. That's it! He must have bruised his brain...


Gohan: Betcha never thought you could fly this fast. Did ya? [Giggling, as Salza, Neiz and Dore pop out]

Salza: So, going somewhere, monkey boy?

Gohan: Uh oh! Icarus, let's get out of here, quick!

Dore: Let em have it, Salza!

Neiz: [Laughing]

[Salza launches his Finger Beam attack on Icarus' wings as Gohan loses control, and the music Falling Down by Breaking Point plays]

Gohan: It's okay I gotcha. [Dore kicks Gohan causing Icarus to fall in the woods] Icarus! [The Armored Squadron hit Gohan causing Dore to grab Gohan}

Dore: [chuckling] Huh? Hey, whatcha got in the bag there, monkey boy. [uses his hands to get the bad] Give it here. Give it. Alright! That's it! You're going bye-bye, kid! [Gohan growls in frustration] I call this mine can-opener with your attack. [he gets blasted in the back by an energy blast]

Neiz: Dore!

Dore: Who did that!?

Piccolo: That would be me!

Salza: A Namek? Out here?

Dore: [about Planet Namek] Why isn't that toad on his own world where he belongs?

Neiz: Frieza blew it up.

Dore: Oh, oh yeah. Yeah.

Gohan: Yeah. Piccolo.

Dore: [to Piccolo] It's all over for you, Namek! You're going to die!

Piccolo: Not likely. [takes off his turban] I've seen you fight.

Dore: I'M GOING RIP YOU APART!!! [Launches up and punches Piccolo's cape] Where'd he go!

[Piccolo appears and hits Dore in the helmet causing him to fall to the ground]

Dore: DARN IT!! I...CAN'T... [blasts Doore, he screams and dies and explodes]

Neiz: Dore. [to Piccolo] You're dead! [growls in frustration, when using a pink shock wave with Piccolo fighting with Salza] Have it! [blasts Piccolo]

Salza: [Evil laughter] You look like a buch of dear caught in the headlights! [Laughs evilly] You lose suckers! Now die! [Piccolo launches a Special Beam Cannon and shot Salza in the back, as he starts gasping, and falls over]

Goku and Krillin: Huh?

Gohan: I don't see him. [giggles] Piccolo! I know you're there! Come out! Piccolo!

[later, Piccolo drinks water, and regenerates as the song Phoneix by Breaking Point plays]

[Credits]


[opening]

Narrator: Previously on Dragon Ball Z: The inhabitants of Earth faced the most terrifying foe they'd ever seen, and it seemed nothing would remain. But Goku and Vegeta made a desperate final stand. Then, Goku summoned a massive Spirit Bomb, drawing on energy from all the revived people of Earth, who rallied to help because of Mr. Satan's plea. And as more energy flowed in from across the universe, this mighty Spirit Bomb proved too powerful for even the destructive alien magic of Majin Buu. Six months later, using the power of the Dragon Balls, humankind's memories of Buu's terror and destruction were erased, and the planet has enjoyed several more months of peace/

Narrator: A Peacetime Reward! Who Gets the 100,000,000 Zeni?!

(Goku drives a tractor on an empty field, dressed in a farmer's outfit. Suddenly, we hear the tractor bump into something and grind to a dead stop.)

Goku: Huh?

(Cut to a view of the back of the tractor being caught on a stump. Goku sighs and gets up to try and uproot the stump with his bare hands, but it won't come out of the ground.)

Goku: You just won't let go, will ya, stump? You're about as stubborn as Vegeta.

(Goku chuckles as he pulls the stump right out of the earth and tosses it aside.)

Goten (o.c.): Hey, daaaaad!

Goku: Huh?

(We see Goten flying in from the distance carrying a long box wrapped in a purple bag.)

Goten: I brought you luuuunnch!

(Goten lands on the field in front of his father.)

Goku: Oh, hey! Kinda early for school to be out, isn't it Goten?

(Goku takes the box from Goten.)

Goten: No, dad, this is Sunday!

Goku: Wow, it is? [chuckles]

(Goku gestures to the tractor behind him with his thumb)

Goku: Well, then you wanna drive the tractor for me while I eat?

Goten: Okay, sure!

(We see Goku pull the lid off of the box.)

Goku: I love lunch so much!

(We see a very generous helping of assorted foods in several red boxes that were all inside of the purple bag. Goku can hardly contain his excitement.)

(Goku sets the lid down and joins his hands together in a quick prayer.)

Goku: Thanks for the grub!

(After a brief pause, Goku starts digging in as he makes short work of the first two boxes. He then eats two more handfuls of food and starts choking for a moment. Goten gets out of the tractor to pat his dad's back to help the food go down. Goten then gets back into the tractor as Goku eats from two more boxes face-first, and ends the meal by washing it down with a drink from a small cup.)

(Goku places the lid back on the final lunch box.)

Goku: That was awesome!

(Goku stands up, fueled up and ready to go.)

Goku: All right.

(Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan with a powerful shout from three different angles. We see Goten driving the tractor as we hear Goku grunting a few yards away as he trains. Goten veers off course a little as he distractedly watches his father train. The tractor starts to roll over a cliff as Goten looks down to see a dense forest below. Goten reacts in fear as the tractor goes tumbling over the edge.)

(Goku notices Goten's cries as the tractor plummets down the cliff. He uses his Instant Transmission technique to teleport a few yards below the tractor and flies up to catch it in one hand.)

Goku: Look, Goten. You've gotta drive a little better than that or I can't focus on my training.

Goten: Do you really think you have to keep training?

Goku: Yeah.

(Goku continues to answer Goten as he ascends back up to the cliff to let the tractor down back on the ground.)

Goku: Majin Buu was ridiculously strong. There's no way I could've stopped him on my own. And you never know, one day someone even stronger could show up. So I've gotta keep training... to keep you guys safe. Make sense?

Goten: Eh, guess so...

(The tractor finally reaches the ground as Goku leans against it to keep talking to his son.)

Goku: The truth is... I'd like to go to King Kai's planet and do some hardcore training. But your mom's not quite sold on it.

(We see a flashback of Chi-Chi angrily responding to Goku's request.)

Chi-Chi: Not a chance, you need to work! YOU'RE GONNA EARN THIS FAMILY SOME MONEY FOR ONCE!!!

(The flashback ends as Goten looks up at his dad sympathetically.)

Goten: Yeah, sometimes I think she must be the strongest on the planet. And I guess she has a point since all of grandpa's treasures burned up in that fire, there's not much money left.

(Cut to Goten's grandpa, Ox-King, slurping ramen noodles in his house. He turns to face the camera, confused that someone's watching him.)

(Cut back to Goten and Goku, as we see a shot of a bird soaring through the sky.)

Goten: But mom says there are ways you can make decent money, dad. You know, like if you did the kinda stuff Mr. Satan does.

Goku: Maybe. But I like being out here where I can sneak in a little training at least.

(Pan to a zoomed out shot of the field, which is peppered with craters from Goku's training and swerving tire tracks from Goten's driving.)

Goten: I'm not sure I'd call it "sneaking in", this field is kind of a mess.

Goku: [chuckles] Yeah.

(Cut to a scene of a small yellow planet in deep space. We then see a green boar-like alien man with a crown barge into a kitchen.)

Alien King: What's takin' so long?! Bring it all in, quickly!

(We see a bunch of alien chefs busy in the kitchen. They work even faster after their king had ordered them to pick up the pace.)

(Cut to a scene of Whis from behind, standing beside a large ornate dining room chair where an unknown creature with a tail and light purple skin is seated in front of a large table. Servants finish up setting the table as two enormous platters of eccentric alien cuisine are lowered down onto its surface.)

Alien King: Lord Beerus... Please, help yourself to this royal feast!

(Cut to Whis from the front, looking unimpressed with the arrangements. Lord Beerus is barely visible in the chair, poring over the food.)

Alien King: Each course has been meticulously crafted by our world's finest chefs, and I can assure you their creations are the definition of exquisite!

(Cut to a close-up shot of Lord Beerus' left eye. Like Whis, he appears to be less than impressed with the food presented to him.)

Lord Beerus: Is that so? Well...

(We get a closer look at the spread of food on the table. Most notably, a large fish with protruding eyes and wedges of fruit soaking in a pool of purple juice, and what appears to be a soufflé with a three headed creature baked inside, bearing tongues that have mouths of their own. There is also a red, octopus-like creature with a single giant eye resting inside of a bowl.)

(Lord Beerus picks up a squishy green ball from the spread and pinches down on it to get a closer look at the blue and pink tendrils leaking out of it. The alien king wrings his hands together nervously.)

(A fork jabs gently at a plate of purple slug-like creatures with green stripes.)

(A cat-like nose and mouth are seen sniffing at a plate of sliced, scaly meat.)

Whis: Please remember your manners, Lord Beerus.

(A fork taps on the rim of a goblet-shaped glass containing a purple, gelatinous substance with sliced fruit on top.)

Lord Beerus (o.c.) And what's this?

(We see the view quickly shift to a couple of chefs standing at attention. The one responsible for the particular cuisine nervously straightens himself and lets out a frightened shriek as he answers loudly.)

Alien Chef: It's a -- a completely organically grown flash pasteurized small batch serving of a la planetaisé, your mighty lordship!

Lord Beerus (o.c.): "A la pra" -- "al" -- "ala pl" -- Are you serious? What an insufferable name.

(The chef goes blue in the face after hearing Lord Beerus' displeasure.)

(Lord Beerus picks up the glass of a la planetaisé and dumps the contents into his mouth. He chews it for a moment and then swallows.)

(The chefs are anxiously waiting for Lord Beerus' verdict, but the king is able to hold it together...)

Lord Beerus (o.c.): Hmm... Tastier than I expected. The use of salt is... divine.

(The alien king is relieved to hear this.)

Alien King: Uhh... Thank you, my lord. So you won't...

Lord Beerus (o.c.): However...

(The alien king shudders in fear again.)

Lord Beerus: There's a greasy mouth feel, which is odd for what I assume is... dessert? Tell you what, I'll only take half.

Alien King: "Half," my lord?

(Lord Beerus' hand is all that's visible as he taps his index finger on the table once, and a ring of destructive purple energy pulsates from the tapped spot.)

(Cut to the same view of the yellow planet from earlier. A purple halo of energy shines out from the equator and gives way to a flash of light as the right half of the planet explodes in a cloud of purple smoke. Lord Beerus and Whis observe the planet's destruction from a distance.)

Whis: A bit harsh for food you called "tasty." Wouldn't you say, my lord?

(Cut to a frontal view of Whis, and Lord Beerus for the first time. Lord Beerus picks at his teeth with his index finger as he answers his assistant.)

Lord Beerus: All that grease is unhealthy. Makes you sluggish all day.

(Lord Beerus removes his finger and stares coldly at the remains of the planet.)

Lord Beerus: I've done this galaxy a favor.

(Cut to a view of Satan City, with its sign featuring Hercule front and center.)

Reporter #1 (o.c.): Mr. Satan, can we get a quote?!

(Cut to a view of a large gold statue built in Mr. Satan's honor as camera flashes go off rapidly in front of it.)

(We now see the swarm of reporters marveling at Mr. Satan from inside his home.)

Reporter #1: How do you feel about receiving the grand prize from the World Peace Assembly? Do you agree they should have done it sooner?

(We now see Mr. Satan seated on a curved pink couch in a suit and bow tie. His faithful dog Bee is curled up on the same couch right next to him.)

Reporter #2: Over here, sir! Let me get some quick shots!

(Mr. Satan holds up his hand to silence the reporters. They all fall silent and watch in awe as he stands from his seat, never once opening his eyes.)

Mr. Satan: I've prepared a statement which I'll now state. I'm proud to say world peace on Earth is now officially permanetized. I say this humbly: We've had zero new alien invaders since I bravely saved us all. That's clearly because the word of my musclebound heroics has spread to the stars. I can see it now...!

(Mr. Satan's background fades into a view of outer space with celestial bodies decorating the cosmos. The reporters are hanging on to his every word.)

Mr. Satan: Villains throughout the cosmos now quiver in fear, knees buckling at the unbridled power of Mr. Satan!

(Mr. Satan demonstrates his strength by punching and kicking randomly to get the crowd going again.)

(Cut to a darkened view of a room with bar stools as Majin Buu steps into view from behind.)

(We see Mr. Satan laughing maniacally at his worldly success as Majin Buu opens a door and spoils the whole thing.)

Majin Buu: What the deal? Buu hungry!

(Mr. Satan's face falls at this unwanted intrusion. The reporters are every bit as stunned as he is. Mr. Satan shakily turns his head to Buu as Caroni turns off the spotlight.)

(We see Buu glaring angrily at Mr. Satan with his eyes closed as his stomach grumbles loudly.)

Mr. Satan (o.c.): Buu!

(Buu walks over to Mr. Satan, clutching his starving stomach with one hand.)

Reporter #1: (hushed) Some pink weirdo has entered the room!

Majin Buu: Mr. Satan, Buu need food!

Mr. Satan: Uhh, Buu! Can't this wait? I'm kinda busy here!

(Majin Buu throws his hands up in the air impatiently. The reporters look on, trying to process the situation.)

Majin Buu: Hungry now!!!

Reporter #1: He yelled at him? A pretty brazen move, yelling at our planet's savior.

Reporter #2: Maybe he's not afraid of him. Maybe he's even stronger!

(Upon hearing this, Mr. Satan turns around anxiously in fear of his cover being blown.)

Mr. Satan: No, it's not like that, everyone stay calm! There's no need to be afraid of this guy! He is an alien, but not an invader! Truth is, he's a galactic warrior who traveled from the farthest reaches of space, and begged me to become his sensei. It was rough at first, but now he's my top pupil!

Reporter #1: Oh, yeah! That makes sense!

Reporter #2: Don't know why I didn't get that! Of course aliens would want Mr. Satan to teach 'em, right?

(Mr. Satan makes a quick sigh of relief and uses some false courage to yell back at Buu.)

Mr. Satan: Now, git! Go back to your training room! I'll be there soon to instruct you in the art of the Dynamite Kick!

Majin Buu: Buu told you, Buu hungry!

Mr. Satan: And your mighty sensei told you to wait in the back!!!

(Buu grumbles angrily at Mr. Satan as Mr. Satan grumbles back while sweating uncontrollably.)

(Buu releases a cloud of steam from the holes on the top of his head. A telltale sign that he's furious. Mr. Satan backs up hastily in fear that he's about to blow his top, but Buu storms out of the room instead. He grumbles one last time at Mr. Satan before exiting through the door. The reporters look on in shock and awe.)

Reporter #1: It's amazing! He's not just the valiant protector of the Earth, he's the greatest hero in the whole universe!

(Cut to Mr. Satan in the reporter's camera cross-hairs as he nervously holds up a peace sign (or 'v' for victory), and more camera flashes go off as the crowd of reporters cause a commotion.)

Mr. Satan: Excuse me while I powder my nose. And go pee.

(Mr. Satan walks away. We then cut to a shot of him massaging Buu's caped shoulders apologetically in the back room.)

Mr. Satan: I'm sorry, Buu! I'm sorry! Come on, don't be mad! You know I love ya! I'll make ya lots of tasty treats later and then maybe a nice bubble bath? Your favorite!

Majin Buu: Hungry now!

(Mr. Satan stops massaging and quickly gets up to run to the pantry.)

Mr. Satan: Okay, okay! Keep your cape on! I'm sure there's chocolate or somethin' in here.

(Mr. Satan opens the cabinet door and gets bombarded by an avalanche of food in cans, bags, and boxes. Buu looks on, not amused as Mr. Satan reaches out for help under all of that food.)

Mr. Satan: Videl! Give your daddy a hand! I can't find the chocolate!!

(Cut to a shot of a book store)

Mr. Satan (o.c.): VIDEL!!!

(We see a book titled "Muzukashii Hon" in someone's hands as he walks down the sidewalk.)

Videl (o.c.): I can't believe we found it.

(We now see Videl walking alongside Gohan as Gohan is the one holding the book, sporting a new pair of yellow-rimmed glasses.)

Videl: Lucky you! You've wanted that book for a while.

Gohan: Oh, yeah! This is gonna make my research a whole lot easier!

(Gohan stops in his tracks as Videl keeps walking. She stops as well to see what's wrong.)

Gohan: Thanks, Videl. I'm not sure I deserve this though.

Videl: [lightly gasps] What's that mean? You've been studying like crazy.

Gohan: I know, but you keep buying me all these incredible gifts like this. And now I feel bad because I can't buy you anything.

Videl (o.c.): There's an easy fix for that. Just don't feel bad.

Gohan: Huh?

(Videl walks back over to Gohan.)

Videl: The best gift you can give me is to keep on studying hard, Gohan.

(Videl takes Gohan's arm in hers.)

Videl: Then, I'll have a scholar as arm candy.

(Gohan smiles appreciatively.)

Gohan: Deal.

Videl: [chuckles] Speaking of arm candy, I want something sweet. Let's try that bakery.

(Zoom out to a shot of Piccolo standing atop a building with his arms folded, watching over Gohan and Videl.)

Piccolo: Hmph!

(Cut to a shot of Capsule Corporation.)

Trunks (o.c.): A present?

(We now see Goten inside Trunks' house while Trunks his doing a handstand with just one finger.)

Goten: Yeah. My brother and Videl got married and I haven't gotten them anything. I wanna find a present that my new sister-in-law will love for sure!

Trunks: Oh... Something she'll love, huh?

(Trunks closes his eyes and strokes his chin thoughtfully. He reopens them after he gets an idea.)

Trunks: For girls. That pretty much means one thing.

Goten: What thing?

(Cut to a view of small engagement rings in a glass case.)

Jewelry store owner (o.c.): So, what do you think?

Rich woman: It's beautiful! But I can't ask you to buy me that, baby. It's too much!

Rich man: Nonsense, dear. I want to!

(The wealthy man points to another selection in the case.)

Rich man: Could we maybe have a look at that one?

(The store owner holds out a much larger diamond ring on display.)

Jewelry store owner: How about this one?

(The rich couple stare in awe at the impressive ring.)

Trunks (o.c.): Are these gag gifts? They're tiny.

Goten (o.c.): Maybe they're rings for babies.

(The woman now looks dissatisfied with the ring after hearing Trunks and Goten trash-talking them in the background.)

Trunks (o.c.): No way she'd be happy with one of these pebbles. You'll have to go way bigger. Unless they come with a magnifying glass!

Goten (o.c.): Yeah!

(The wealthy man is now looking agitated as the woman's expectations for the ring continue to rise.)

(Cut to the jewelry store owner as Trunks somehow towers over him. The store owner's eyebrow twitches impatiently.)

Jewelry store owner: Uhh, hello... Can I help you boys?

(We now see that Goten and Trunks are hovering over the rich couple, directly behind them, looking over the same rings they were. Goten looks off to the side.)

Goten: Over there, maybe?

Trunks: Let's go see.

(Goten and Trunks fly over in the direction behind them, freaking out the couple and store owner as the couple embraces each other in fear.)

(We see Goten and Trunks hovering over another counter as another sales clerk is throwing her hands up in the air in shock. Goten isn't impressed with this selection either.)

Goten: Nah, these are tiny too.

Trunks: You should get her something else.

Goten: All right.

(Goten and Trunks fly toward the exit and land on the ground before running out of the store. We now see the store owner and the rich couple just as stunned as they were a moment ago.)

Rich man: You see that?!

Rich woman: They can fly!

(The wealthy man's toupee falls off from all the excitement. After what those three just witnessed, nobody gives a care in the world about it.)

(Cut to a scene of a man gently prodding a woman's cheek to see how soft her skin is.)

Man: Whoa! Wow! Your skin really does feel softer now! Seriously, is it made of butter? I just can't stop touching your face!

(We see Goten and Trunks sitting down at a nearby park, still trying to think of the perfect gift.)

Goten: I don't know what to get her!

Trunks: Yeah, jewels are out. We gotta get creative. Hmm... How about o' de toletty?

Goten: O' de what now?

Trunks: It's fancy talk for "toilet water," and ladies like to put it on their face at night. At least my mom does.

(We see a flashback of Trunks brushing his teeth before bed as he watches his mom, Bulma, trying on lotions in front of the bathroom mirror.)

Bulma (o.c.): Smells nice, but it's wrong for my skin type.

Bulma: Well, maybe I should give it to Videl. She might think she's too young for skin care, but if she's not on it like me, one day she'll wake up looking like Master Roshi.

(Cut back to Goten and Trunks, who are happy with this new idea.)

Goten: Well, if your mom likes it, then I'm sure Videl will too, right?

Trunks: To the girly store!

Goten: Yeah!

(Goten and Trunks hop to their feet and take off into the sky.)

(Cut to a series of shots showing shelves of expensive lotions, going from 3,000 zeni, to 5,000 zeni, to one going all the way to 30,000 zeni.)

Goten: I can't afford this stuff on my allowance.

(Goten and Trunks hang their heads in defeat. Looks like it's back to the drawing board.)

(Cut to a shot of a displeased elderly man's mustached mouth as he shouts angrily at a sales clerk.)

Old man: 6,000 zeni! That's highway robbery!

(Goten and Trunks overhear him and turn around to see what the fuss is about.)

Old man (o.c.): Where do you get off charging that much?!

(We see the elderly man, holding himself up with a cane, as the cosmetics sales clerk tries to talk him down.)

Cosmetics sales woman: Well, sir. This is our ultra-advanced hydrating formula with rare, skin-nourishing compounds. You can find this anywhere else.

Old man: Like hell, I can't, missy! The hot springs back home work better than this fancy crap! And they don't cost me an arm and a leg!

(Cut back to Goten and Trunks listening on.)

Old man (o.c.): Three days soakin' in there is all you need! Even turns an old lady's skin smooth as a baby's butt!

(Goten and Trunks are surprised to hear this and run over to the elderly man.)

Trunks: Hey, old dude! Those hot springs! How do we get there, man?

Old man: 'Scuse me?

Trunks: The hot springs! The ones you just said are great for your skin, even for broke-down old lady butt!

Old man: Wow, you're a good eavesdropper.

(The elderly man bends over backward and points behind him.)

Old man: You go a looong way in that direction!

(The elderly man straightens himself out and points his cane and whole body over to the left.)

Old man: Then, at the woods, take a hard left!

(The elderly man now holds the cane up and holds his arms up as he moves his body around in a bizarre, swirling motion.)

Old man: And you'll find the spring swirling up in the mountains!

(Goten and Trunks exchanges excited glances and look back at the elderly man with excited faces.)

Goten & Trunks: Thank you, old dude!

(We now see Goten and Trunks flying over the grassy ground outside of town; Goten is carrying a glass jar.)

Trunks: "A long way in this direction..."

Goten: "Then at the woods, a hard left."

(Goten and Trunks follow the path they remember from the elderly man and fly off toward the mountains.)

Goten: Nothing's here.

Trunks: Hmm... Oh!

(Goten and Trunks look down to see what they can find, but Trunks has spotted something. They fly in for a closer look.)

Trunks: Is that it?

(We see the hot spring the elderly man was talking about. His description was heavily exaggerated, because it's revealed to be filled with filthy water as a bunch of elderly people are soaking in it. A close-up of an elderly man shows him sneezing his dentures out into the water.)

(Cut back to Goten and Trunks, who figure this can't be the hot spring the old man was talking about.)

Goten: That water looks kinda dirty, huh?

Trunks: Probably 'cuz all those nasty people are in it. Maybe let's go look higher up the mountain.

(We see a shot of a forest as Goten and Trunks fly overhead. Then cut back to Goten and Trunks looking over the area as they fly.)

Goten: Can't we just get it from a toilet?

(Trunks spots something again, but this time it's much more promising: a fresh-water lake hidden in the back of the forest.)

Trunks: Look, over there!

(Cut to a shot of a few fish swimming in the clean water.)

Goten (o.c.): Wow, it's crystal clear!

Goten: I bet she'll like that way better, right?

Trunks: Yeah!

(Goten and Trunks come down for a landing near the lake.)

Trunks: Perfect gift achieved!

(Cut to a shot of something green and scaly ominously slithering through the leaves.)

(We see Goten dipping his jar into the water to fill it up.)

Goten: All right... Little more!

(Goten dips the jar in deeper to try and fill it up faster.)

Goten: Fill up all the way!

Trunks: Careful, don't fall in.

Goten: I know, I know!

(We see a predator stalking Goten and Trunks from inside the bushes. A snake-like tongue flails out as the giant reptile hisses hungrily at them.)

(Goten takes his jar out of the water and sticks the cork back in, chuckling in success.)

Trunks: Nice! Let's head back.

Goten: M-hm!

(The giant snake lunges out at them from the bushes, separating Goten and Trunks as Goten looses his grip on the jar and it flies out of his hands. Trunks notices and lands on his feet, skidding to a stop.)

Trunks: Hold on, I got it!

(Trunks jumps back into the air and catches the jar with one hand just before it crashes to the ground, as he hops back up to avoid the snake coming in for a second attack.)

(Cut to a full frame view of the giant snake hissing viciously a Goten and Trunks. They aren't the least bit intimidated by it.)

Trunks: Hey, watch it, buddy! If you want toilet water, get your own!

(The snake lurches forward again as Trunks jumps out of the way. It keeps snapping its jaws at him, but Trunks dodges every strike. He then runs along the snake's tail and jumps up again to try and get away. The snake is still hot on his trail though, and gets closer and closer to chomping at him.)

Trunks: Goten!

(Trunks tosses the jar at Goten, who holds out his hands ready to catch it.)

Goten: Okay, I'm ready!

(Goten catches the jar, but the snake wraps itself around him and slithers around in tremulous motions, disorienting Goten.)

Goten: Trunks, here!

(Goten tosses the jar back at Trunks, who is now back on solid ground. He catches it easily.)

Trunks: Right!

(The snake's shadow covers Trunks as it goes in for another bite, but Trunks dashes out of the way with superhuman speed. Now he's getting annoyed...)

Trunks: Hey! Knock it off!

(Trunks kicks the snake, but it barely even fazes it. Goten tries punching it in the face, which ends up dealing much better damage. The snake angrily goes in for the kill again, but Goten and Trunks keep hopping out of its way, the jar still in Trunks' hands.)

Trunks: He doesn't quit, does he?!

(Goten jumps up and hops off of the snake to give him a boost as he lands back to the ground and charges a Kamehame-Ha. Trunks is alarmed by this.)

Trunks: Hang on, Goten, no! You're too close to the hot springs, it's too dangerous!

(Cut to a shot of the elderly hot springs, showing all of the people who could accidentally get caught in Goten's blast. Cut back to Goten, who calls off the attack and takes to the air to avoid another lunge by the snake. Trunks tosses the jar up at him again.)

Trunks: Your turn, catch!

(The snake bats the jar away with its tail before Goten can catch it. Trunks has had all he can stand at this point... He lunges at the snake and punches it through the entire forest and into a large tree. He readies himself to deliver another beat-down, but the snake is aghast and withdraws into the woods to escape.)

(Trunks returns to Goten to check out the damages.)

Trunks: Is the jar messed up?

(Cut to a shot of Goten from behind. We can tell he's holding the jar, but we have no idea what kind of condition it's in. Goten then turns around and smiles as he holds up the jar filled with lake water, completely intact without a scratch on it.)

(Cut to a shot of a large red house in Satan City. We then see Videl stirring a pot on the stove.

Trunks (o.c.): Yoo-hoo, Videl!

(Trunks' voice can be heard in the background along with light tapping on windowed glass.)

Videl: Huh?

(Videl turns around smiling, already knowing who to expect. She sees Goten and Trunks hovering outside of her window, smiling and chuckling back at her. Goten is holding his arms behind his back.)

(We see Goten and Trunks now inside the house as Goten holds out his present.)

Goten: Here! It's my mega-special wedding gift!

Videl: Wow! That's for me? That's so thoughtful. Thanks, Goten.

Gohan (o.c.): Goten! Trunks! When'd you get here?

(Gohan walks into the room, happy to see his little brother and childhood friend.)

Goten: Hey, Gohan!

(Gohan notices the jar of water that Videl is holding.)

Gohan: Hm? Hey, what's that?

Videl: This is a wedding gift, from your little brother.

Goten: It's toilet water!

Gohan: Uhh... What?

Goten: It's for her face! Trunks helped me get it up on a mountain!

(Trunks smiles and chuckles proudly as Videl tries to piece together what they could mean.)

Videl: You mean eau de toilette. Sounds like you went to a lot of trouble.

Trunks: Don't you wanna try some?

Videl: Sure!

(Videl drops some of the water into the palm of her hand and rubs it together as she applies it to her face. She's surprised by how it feels.)

Videl: (thinking) Is this just ordinary water?

(Videl sees Goten and Trunks smiling and chuckling proudly over their accomplishment. She smiles knowingly and continues to rub it on her cheeks.)

Trunks (o.c.): Pretty smooth, huh?

Goten: You like it?!

Videl: Yeah, it's great! My skin feels incredible! Thanks, Goten, and thank you, Trunks. I'm a lucky girl!

(Goten and Trunks are beaming in excitement and chuckle happily.)

Goten: Well, just let me know if you run out! I'll get you more anytime!

(Videl nods her head and chuckles sweetly.)

(Fade to a view of Goku watching the sunset with Goten out on the field Goku works at.)

Goku: You did a really good thing, Goten. I'm sure you made Videl's day.

Goten: [chuckles]

Goku: So, what's their house like?

Goten: It's super big!

Goku: Well, Mr. Satan had it built, so I bet it is. Sure was nice of him. Now Gohan can study all he wants and not worry about bills!

(We hear a vehicle rolling up as a car horn lightly beeps at Goku and Goten. They turn around to see a black car nearby slowing to a stop with the word "Satan" printed on the side. Mr. Satan himself steps out of the vehicle.)

Mr. Satan: Hey, there! Great to see ya, Goku!

(Mr. Satan slowly walks toward Goku and Goten, carrying a briefcase.)

Mr. Satan: I've been looking for ya! Chi-Chi told me you'd be up here.

Goku (o.c.): Oh, hey, Mr. Satan!

Goku: Well, that's funny, we were just talkin' about you. You're a good man. I can't thank you enough for buying that huge house for Gohan.

(Mr. Satan sets the briefcase down on the ground as he walks up to Goku and Goten.)

Mr. Satan: It was my pleasure! I mean, what do ya expect? Videl's my baby girl!

(Mr. Satan gets serious for a moment and whispers into Goku's ear.)

Mr. Satan: (whispering) But enough about the house, that's not why I'm here. Did you happen to see the news today?

Goku: (trying to whisper back) No. I don't watch T.V.

Mr. Satan (no longer whispering) All right then, I'll tell ya. I got an award today, grand prize in fact, from the World Peace Assembly, for savin' the Earth from certain doom.

Goku: Ya don't say.

Mr. Satan: Yeah. You might remember how it kinda got around that I saved the world from Armageddon?

(Pan to the briefcase as Mr. Satan continues to explain his business being there.)

Mr. Satan: Well, that's what it's for. And the prize money is, uhh, substantial: 100,000,000 zeni.

(Cut to Mr. Satan's agent, Miss Piiza, leaning against the car as Goku and Goten scream out in surprise. She turns her head curiously.)

Goku & Goten: 100,000,000?!?!?!

(Mr. Satan shushes them harshly, and they immediately obey by covering their own mouths.)

(Mr. Satan sighs in relief and picks up the briefcase once again. He smiles and holds it up to Goku.)

Mr. Satan: But the point is, you're the only one who really deserves this dough. So I'm handin' it over.

(Goku holds up his hands to stop him. He is not comfortable with this idea.)

Goku: Whoa, whoa! I can't accept that!

Mr. Satan: Come on, don't be silly, you earned it, brother!

(Mr. Satan holds the briefcase out closer to Goku, but Goku tries to push it away.)

Goku: No, seriously, I'm fine, I wasn't the only one fighting him! You did your part too... in your own way!

Mr. Satan: But I've already got too much money to count!

(Goku has nearly pushed the briefcase all the way back into Mr. Satan's chest by now.)

Mr. Satan: Besides, Vegeta... said no too. Heh! But of course, that guy's married into the richest family on Earth!

Goku: Hold on.

(Goku whispers into Mr. Satan's ear.)

Goku: (whispering) How much is 100,000,000 zeni? Is that more than 100,000?

Mr. Satan: Huh? Eh, well, yeah! Of course! Let's see, it's uhh... a thousand times more in fact?

(Goku recoils after hearing this. He looks terrified by the prospect.)

Goku: Aah! A thousand times more than 100,000?!

(Goku backs up and shakes his hands at Mr. Satan in protest.)

Goku: Well, now I really don't want it!

(Cut to Goten, looking on with an impressionable expression.)

Goku: Where would I put it?! I don't have a treasure cave!

Goten: I... think you should take it, dad.

Goku: Huh?

Goten: If you come home with all of that money, then mom won't worry about you having a job. So you could go train with King Kai.

(Goku looks at him excitedly.)

Goku: Ya think so? Uh...

(Goku looks back at Mr. Satan and rubs the back of his neck guiltily.)

Goku: But it's so much...

Mr. Satan: Come on, Goku. Listen to your boy and take the cash. I swear it won't bite.

(Goku's very conflicted, he's really on the fence about taking this money. He groans reluctantly a little before putting on a serious face as he comes to a decision.)

Goku: Fine, I'll take it! We could use the money. So, you're sure you don't want it?

(Mr. Satan nods his head as Goku hesitantly reaches out to take the handle of the briefcase.)

Goku: Well, okay... Thank you.

Mr. Satan: Yeah! That's a relief! Now, uhh... I hate askin' for somethin' in return here, but... can you keep this on the lowdown?

(Cut to Goku and Goten eyeing the briefcase in Goku's hand.)

Mr. Satan: I got a reputation to protect.

(Goku and Goten blink simultaneously in confusion.)

(Cut to Goku and Chi-Chi's house at night with the lights still on inside.)

Chi-Chi (o.c.): 100,000,00 ZENI?!?!?!

(Cut to a shot of the money in the briefcase, dispersed in 10,000 zeni bills with an image of Tori-Bot featured on each bill.)

(We see Chi-Chi patting Goku's back for a job well done while she lustfully stares at the pile of cash in front of her. Goten is in the room as well, standing right next to them as this plays out.)

Chi-Chi: I don't even know what to say, Goku! With this money, we can afford any school we want for Goten! And lots of private tutors and anything else he needs! It's a dream!

Goku: I'm glad you like it. So, uhh... I was wondering if I could, ya know, train with King Kai now?

Chi-Chi: (absentmindedly) Yeah, sure. Just drop by from time to time, okay?

(Goku grins widely upon hearing this.)

Goku: Awesome!

(Goku glances at Goten, who smiles up at him, happy for his dad.)

Goku: All right, then! See ya soon!

(Goku places his index and middle fingers on his forehead to use the Instant Transmission technique and teleport out of the house.)

(Cut back to the outside view of Goku and Chi-Chi's house.)

Chi-Chi (o.c.): I'm gonna start looking for tutors right now, and private schools, and after-school schools! Goten, you're gonna know everything!

(We see Master Roshi barreling toward the house, running full-speed in crazed excitement.)

Master Roshi: Yea-heah!!!

(Master Roshi barges into the house looking for Goku, and ends up in the same room with Chi-Chi.)

Master Roshi: Goku! Is it true you really got 100,000,000 zeni?! That's a game-changer! Do you have any idea how many dirty movie DVDs you could buy with that kind of load?!

(Slow zoom in on the back of Chi-Chi's head. You can tell she's about to unleash her patented maternal wrath on the deluded old man.)

Master Roshi: YOU COULD EVEN GO BLU-RAY!!!

(Chi-Chi turns to face him, growling angrily with literal fire in her steely, furious glare.)

Chi-Chi: YOU THINK I'D LET YOU BLOW OUR MONEY ON FILTH?!?!?!

(Chi-Chi kicks Master Roshi out of the house and he hightails it out of there.)

(Slow pan up to the cloudy night sky. A twinkle of light shines in the distance. Fade into the soulless black pupil of Kibito Kai, and slowly zoom out as he stares up at the sky with mounting apprehension. Blustering winds race through the Sacred World of the Kais where Kibito Kai is standing and the Elder Kai is watching in awe.)

Kibito Kai: Ancestor... Another planet has been decimated. Just what could be happening out there?

Elder Kai: Hmm...

(Cut to a shot of the purple sky as a handful of planets can be seen in the distance, varying in size and proximity.)

[opening]

Narrator: Last time on Dragon Ball, Sergeant Major Murasaki charged into action! This tricky ninja stopped that nothing can prevent Goku from rescuing the village chief. The battle was fierce, but our hero was upped to the challenge. He prroves that you should never underestimate a boy and his bow. Especially with that boy is Goku! Murasaki attacked using all of the technique to his disposal, but Goku was able to handle every surprise the ninja threw his way.

Goku: That wasn't fair! You said you didn't have a weapon!

Narrator: Every surprise it is. Except one.

Ninja Murasaki: Now you know why they call me... The Messenger of Death! [evil laughter]

[Five Murasakis appear in the text]

[This scene starts with outside of Muscle Tower still snowing, itside Muscle Tower with Goku down]

General White: Yes! That's what I call results! [laughs, then gasps, starts looking at Goku moving, and Murasaki looking at the camera with two fingers]

Ninja Murasaki: K.O. K.O. K.O. [laughs manically, and screams]

Goku: [grunting and gets up] Ow! Ow! No more dirty tricks! It's my turn!

Ninja Murasaki: Impossible. No one could have survived the kind of blow that hit no one. [to Goku] What are you trying to do to me!? Get back on the ground where you belong!!

[Goku rushes to Muraski fast, he screams and runs fast as Goku continues running him, he screams again while Goku keeps on running as Murasaki jumps on the branch of a tree swinging up and down and laughs and throws stars at a tree and runs and jumps onver the bushes and rushes to the house and closes the door]

Goku: [picks up stars] Hey! Missed me! You better not be hiding again! [opens the door and rushes inside] Huh?

Ninja Murasaki: What took you so long?

Goku: [growls]

Ninja Murasaki: Ha-ha. Ha-ha. Go ahead. Take your best shot if you can.

[Goku throws stars so Murasaki uses the mat to block his attack]

Goku: Whoa.

Ninja Murasaki: [laughs] I called that the overturn mat trick!

Goku: Catch this one! [throws the stars, as Murasaki blocks it with the mat, he throws and blocks the star again, and throws the star and he blocks it again, continues throwing the stars and he uses too many mats, and Murasaki laughs]

Goku: Whoa.

Ninja Murasaki: [laughing] What's the matter? Out of stars?

Goku: No. [throws the star]

Ninja Murasaki: Hey! No mat! [the ninja star stabs Murasaki in the forehead, notices and freaks out] LOOK AT ME!! I'M DEFORMED!! I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE SHOWED THE EXTRA TWENTY FIVE ZENI FOR THE COMPLETE SET, BUT NO!! WHEN AM I GONNA NEED SIX MATS I SAY!! WELL, THAT'S THE LAST TIME I BROUGHT THESE MATS!!

General White: [growls in frustration]

[the guard opens the door, presses the up button opens the door to the cell with the Village Chief]

Jingle Village Chief: How will my village survive without my guidance? I must find away to return to them. I need my help.

[the dog soldier opens the cell door with food]

Dog Soldier: Alright, old timer. Food's here. [pause] Hey! Old man! Are you deaf!?

Jingle Village Chief: I will not eat while I am your prisoner. Send the food to my people.

Dog Soldier: [puts the food on the table] Fine. Let the rats have it!

Jingle Village Chief: What's all that noise downstairs?

Dog Soldier: It's nothing. There's some little boy running around.

Jingle Village Chief: A little boy?

Dog Soldier: [chuckles] He sneaked in. I guess to rescue you. Don't worry he's probably into a million pieces by now.

Jingle Village Chief: What? [grabs the dog soldier] Why you!? Picking on an old man is one thing! but a little child! You are barbaric! What if that were your own son!? What kind of army fights children!?

Dog Soldier: Let go of me you old fool! If he were my kid, I wouldn't send him here in the first place! What's the matter, aren't there any men in your village? Hm! Pathetic! [he leaves the cell]

Jingle Village Chief: What am I going to do? [smoke comes from the coco] I've got to do something and  quickly. That poor little boy is was- [notices the coco smell] Coco! My favorite!

[Outside of Muscle Tower, with Murasaki start running fast and laughs with Goku running as well]

Goku: Hey wait! Wait! Stop! Will ya!? I don't have time for this!

[Murasaki stops to the lake and throws the smoke bomb at Goku as he coughs]

Ninja Murasaki: [puts on paddle shoes] Easy. Let's see you follow me now! [walks on top of the water]

Goku: [coughing] Huh?

Ninja Murasaki: [laughing]

Goku: [gasps]

Ninja Murasaki: See you on the otherside, brat! [walks to the grass]

Goku: Need juice. But what's the big deal. I can just swim across

Ninja Murasaki: Sure, that's a great idea, kid. Dive right in, if you wanna lose some weight, say, all your pounds! See, this is a special pond... full of piranhas!

Goku: Full of pajamas?

Ninja Murasaki: [falls down, and gets up] Are you deaf!? I said piranhas! A ferocious carnivore's tropical freshwater fish of the genosenesomas in other words it's a little fish with a big big bite!

Goku: What's that? I can't hear you!

Ninja Murasaki: You try my patience! Watch this! [throws a fish in the water and the piranhas eat the fish leaving but the head and the bones with Goku screaming, he screams too, and laughs] Go ahead! Just try and cross the pond! I dare you! [taunts]

Goku: Okay! [he jumps really high and lands on the ground] Hi there!

Ninja Murasaki: I've got to be dreaming!

Goku: [giggles] Boy that was fun. Why don't you try it, or you want to fight some more?

Ninja Murasaki: I am sick and tired of playing silly games with you boy! This has got to stop!

Goku: So, does this mean that you're ready to give up now?

Ninja Murasaki: [face turns red and growls] That does it! That is the last straw little boy!

Goku: You look a little upset.

Ninja Murasaki: I'm not upset! Oh no! I'm way past upset! I'm furious!!

Goku: Oh, that's mad. Right?


[opening]

Narrator: Previously on Dragon Ball Z: The inhabitants of Earth faced the most terrifying foe they'd ever seen, and it seemed nothing would remain. But Goku and Vegeta made a desperate final stand. Then, Goku summoned a massive Spirit Bomb, drawing on energy from all the revived people of Earth, who rallied to help because of Mr. Satan's plea. And as more energy flowed in from across the universe, this mighty Spirit Bomb proved too powerful for even the destructive alien magic of Majin Buu. Six months later, using the power of the Dragon Balls, humankind's memories of Buu's terror and destruction were erased, and the planet has enjoyed several more months of peace/

Narrator: A Peacetime Reward! Who Gets the 100,000,000 Zeni?!

(Goku drives a tractor on an empty field, dressed in a farmer's outfit. Suddenly, we hear the tractor bump into something and grind to a dead stop.)

Goku: Huh?

(Cut to a view of the back of the tractor being caught on a stump. Goku sighs and gets up to try and uproot the stump with his bare hands, but it won't come out of the ground.)

Goku: You just won't let go, will ya, stump? You're about as stubborn as Vegeta.

(Goku chuckles as he pulls the stump right out of the earth and tosses it aside.)

Goten (o.c.): Hey, daaaaad!

Goku: Huh?

(We see Goten flying in from the distance carrying a long box wrapped in a purple bag.)

Goten: I brought you luuuunnch!

(Goten lands on the field in front of his father.)

Goku: Oh, hey! Kinda early for school to be out, isn't it Goten?

(Goku takes the box from Goten.)

Goten: No, dad, this is Sunday!

Goku: Wow, it is? [chuckles]

(Goku gestures to the tractor behind him with his thumb)

Goku: Well, then you wanna drive the tractor for me while I eat?

Goten: Okay, sure!

(We see Goku pull the lid off of the box.)

Goku: I love lunch so much!

(We see a very generous helping of assorted foods in several red boxes that were all inside of the purple bag. Goku can hardly contain his excitement.)

(Goku sets the lid down and joins his hands together in a quick prayer.)

Goku: Thanks for the grub!

(After a brief pause, Goku starts digging in as he makes short work of the first two boxes. He then eats two more handfuls of food and starts choking for a moment. Goten gets out of the tractor to pat his dad's back to help the food go down. Goten then gets back into the tractor as Goku eats from two more boxes face-first, and ends the meal by washing it down with a drink from a small cup.)

(Goku places the lid back on the final lunch box.)

Goku: That was awesome!

(Goku stands up, fueled up and ready to go.)

Goku: All right.

(Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan with a powerful shout from three different angles. We see Goten driving the tractor as we hear Goku grunting a few yards away as he trains. Goten veers off course a little as he distractedly watches his father train. The tractor starts to roll over a cliff as Goten looks down to see a dense forest below. Goten reacts in fear as the tractor goes tumbling over the edge.)

(Goku notices Goten's cries as the tractor plummets down the cliff. He uses his Instant Transmission technique to teleport a few yards below the tractor and flies up to catch it in one hand.)

Goku: Look, Goten. You've gotta drive a little better than that or I can't focus on my training.

Goten: Do you really think you have to keep training?

Goku: Yeah.

(Goku continues to answer Goten as he ascends back up to the cliff to let the tractor down back on the ground.)

Goku: Majin Buu was ridiculously strong. There's no way I could've stopped him on my own. And you never know, one day someone even stronger could show up. So I've gotta keep training... to keep you guys safe. Make sense?

Goten: Eh, guess so...

(The tractor finally reaches the ground as Goku leans against it to keep talking to his son.)

Goku: The truth is... I'd like to go to King Kai's planet and do some hardcore training. But your mom's not quite sold on it.

(We see a flashback of Chi-Chi angrily responding to Goku's request.)

Chi-Chi: Not a chance, you need to work! YOU'RE GONNA EARN THIS FAMILY SOME MONEY FOR ONCE!!!

(The flashback ends as Goten looks up at his dad sympathetically.)

Goten: Yeah, sometimes I think she must be the strongest on the planet. And I guess she has a point since all of grandpa's treasures burned up in that fire, there's not much money left.

(Cut to Goten's grandpa, Ox-King, slurping ramen noodles in his house. He turns to face the camera, confused that someone's watching him.)

(Cut back to Goten and Goku, as we see a shot of a bird soaring through the sky.)

Goten: But mom says there are ways you can make decent money, dad. You know, like if you did the kinda stuff Mr. Satan does.

Goku: Maybe. But I like being out here where I can sneak in a little training at least.

(Pan to a zoomed out shot of the field, which is peppered with craters from Goku's training and swerving tire tracks from Goten's driving.)

Goten: I'm not sure I'd call it "sneaking in", this field is kind of a mess.

Goku: [chuckles] Yeah.

(Cut to a scene of a small yellow planet in deep space. We then see a green boar-like alien man with a crown barge into a kitchen.)

Alien King: What's takin' so long?! Bring it all in, quickly!

(We see a bunch of alien chefs busy in the kitchen. They work even faster after their king had ordered them to pick up the pace.)

(Cut to a scene of Whis from behind, standing beside a large ornate dining room chair where an unknown creature with a tail and light purple skin is seated in front of a large table. Servants finish up setting the table as two enormous platters of eccentric alien cuisine are lowered down onto its surface.)

Alien King: Lord Beerus... Please, help yourself to this royal feast!

(Cut to Whis from the front, looking unimpressed with the arrangements. Lord Beerus is barely visible in the chair, poring over the food.)

Alien King: Each course has been meticulously crafted by our world's finest chefs, and I can assure you their creations are the definition of exquisite!

(Cut to a close-up shot of Lord Beerus' left eye. Like Whis, he appears to be less than impressed with the food presented to him.)

Lord Beerus: Is that so? Well...

(We get a closer look at the spread of food on the table. Most notably, a large fish with protruding eyes and wedges of fruit soaking in a pool of purple juice, and what appears to be a soufflé with a three headed creature baked inside, bearing tongues that have mouths of their own. There is also a red, octopus-like creature with a single giant eye resting inside of a bowl.)

(Lord Beerus picks up a squishy green ball from the spread and pinches down on it to get a closer look at the blue and pink tendrils leaking out of it. The alien king wrings his hands together nervously.)

(A fork jabs gently at a plate of purple slug-like creatures with green stripes.)

(A cat-like nose and mouth are seen sniffing at a plate of sliced, scaly meat.)

Whis: Please remember your manners, Lord Beerus.

(A fork taps on the rim of a goblet-shaped glass containing a purple, gelatinous substance with sliced fruit on top.)

Lord Beerus (o.c.) And what's this?

(We see the view quickly shift to a couple of chefs standing at attention. The one responsible for the particular cuisine nervously straightens himself and lets out a frightened shriek as he answers loudly.)

Alien Chef: It's a -- a completely organically grown flash pasteurized small batch serving of a la planetaisé, your mighty lordship!

Lord Beerus (o.c.): "A la pra" -- "al" -- "ala pl" -- Are you serious? What an insufferable name.

(The chef goes blue in the face after hearing Lord Beerus' displeasure.)

(Lord Beerus picks up the glass of a la planetaisé and dumps the contents into his mouth. He chews it for a moment and then swallows.)

(The chefs are anxiously waiting for Lord Beerus' verdict, but the king is able to hold it together...)

Lord Beerus (o.c.): Hmm... Tastier than I expected. The use of salt is... divine.

(The alien king is relieved to hear this.)

Alien King: Uhh... Thank you, my lord. So you won't...

Lord Beerus (o.c.): However...

(The alien king shudders in fear again.)

Lord Beerus: There's a greasy mouth feel, which is odd for what I assume is... dessert? Tell you what, I'll only take half.

Alien King: "Half," my lord?

(Lord Beerus' hand is all that's visible as he taps his index finger on the table once, and a ring of destructive purple energy pulsates from the tapped spot.)

(Cut to the same view of the yellow planet from earlier. A purple halo of energy shines out from the equator and gives way to a flash of light as the right half of the planet explodes in a cloud of purple smoke. Lord Beerus and Whis observe the planet's destruction from a distance.)

Whis: A bit harsh for food you called "tasty." Wouldn't you say, my lord?

(Cut to a frontal view of Whis, and Lord Beerus for the first time. Lord Beerus picks at his teeth with his index finger as he answers his assistant.)

Lord Beerus: All that grease is unhealthy. Makes you sluggish all day.

(Lord Beerus removes his finger and stares coldly at the remains of the planet.)

Lord Beerus: I've done this galaxy a favor.

(Cut to a view of Satan City, with its sign featuring Hercule front and center.)

Reporter #1 (o.c.): Mr. Satan, can we get a quote?!

(Cut to a view of a large gold statue built in Mr. Satan's honor as camera flashes go off rapidly in front of it.)

(We now see the swarm of reporters marveling at Mr. Satan from inside his home.)

Reporter #1: How do you feel about receiving the grand prize from the World Peace Assembly? Do you agree they should have done it sooner?

(We now see Mr. Satan seated on a curved pink couch in a suit and bow tie. His faithful dog Bee is curled up on the same couch right next to him.)

Reporter #2: Over here, sir! Let me get some quick shots!

(Mr. Satan holds up his hand to silence the reporters. They all fall silent and watch in awe as he stands from his seat, never once opening his eyes.)

Mr. Satan: I've prepared a statement which I'll now state. I'm proud to say world peace on Earth is now officially permanetized. I say this humbly: We've had zero new alien invaders since I bravely saved us all. That's clearly because the word of my musclebound heroics has spread to the stars. I can see it now...!

(Mr. Satan's background fades into a view of outer space with celestial bodies decorating the cosmos. The reporters are hanging on to his every word.)

Mr. Satan: Villains throughout the cosmos now quiver in fear, knees buckling at the unbridled power of Mr. Satan!

(Mr. Satan demonstrates his strength by punching and kicking randomly to get the crowd going again.)

(Cut to a darkened view of a room with bar stools as Majin Buu steps into view from behind.)

(We see Mr. Satan laughing maniacally at his worldly success as Majin Buu opens a door and spoils the whole thing.)

Majin Buu: What the deal? Buu hungry!

(Mr. Satan's face falls at this unwanted intrusion. The reporters are every bit as stunned as he is. Mr. Satan shakily turns his head to Buu as Caroni turns off the spotlight.)

(We see Buu glaring angrily at Mr. Satan with his eyes closed as his stomach grumbles loudly.)

Mr. Satan (o.c.): Buu!

(Buu walks over to Mr. Satan, clutching his starving stomach with one hand.)

Reporter #1: (hushed) Some pink weirdo has entered the room!

Majin Buu: Mr. Satan, Buu need food!

Mr. Satan: Uhh, Buu! Can't this wait? I'm kinda busy here!

(Majin Buu throws his hands up in the air impatiently. The reporters look on, trying to process the situation.)

Majin Buu: Hungry now!!!

Reporter #1: He yelled at him? A pretty brazen move, yelling at our planet's savior.

Reporter #2: Maybe he's not afraid of him. Maybe he's even stronger!

(Upon hearing this, Mr. Satan turns around anxiously in fear of his cover being blown.)

Mr. Satan: No, it's not like that, everyone stay calm! There's no need to be afraid of this guy! He is an alien, but not an invader! Truth is, he's a galactic warrior who traveled from the farthest reaches of space, and begged me to become his sensei. It was rough at first, but now he's my top pupil!

Reporter #1: Oh, yeah! That makes sense!

Reporter #2: Don't know why I didn't get that! Of course aliens would want Mr. Satan to teach 'em, right?

(Mr. Satan makes a quick sigh of relief and uses some false courage to yell back at Buu.)

Mr. Satan: Now, git! Go back to your training room! I'll be there soon to instruct you in the art of the Dynamite Kick!

Majin Buu: Buu told you, Buu hungry!

Mr. Satan: And your mighty sensei told you to wait in the back!!!

(Buu grumbles angrily at Mr. Satan as Mr. Satan grumbles back while sweating uncontrollably.)

(Buu releases a cloud of steam from the holes on the top of his head. A telltale sign that he's furious. Mr. Satan backs up hastily in fear that he's about to blow his top, but Buu storms out of the room instead. He grumbles one last time at Mr. Satan before exiting through the door. The reporters look on in shock and awe.)

Reporter #1: It's amazing! He's not just the valiant protector of the Earth, he's the greatest hero in the whole universe!

(Cut to Mr. Satan in the reporter's camera cross-hairs as he nervously holds up a peace sign (or 'v' for victory), and more camera flashes go off as the crowd of reporters cause a commotion.)

Mr. Satan: Excuse me while I powder my nose. And go pee.

(Mr. Satan walks away. We then cut to a shot of him massaging Buu's caped shoulders apologetically in the back room.)

Mr. Satan: I'm sorry, Buu! I'm sorry! Come on, don't be mad! You know I love ya! I'll make ya lots of tasty treats later and then maybe a nice bubble bath? Your favorite!

Majin Buu: Hungry now!

(Mr. Satan stops massaging and quickly gets up to run to the pantry.)

Mr. Satan: Okay, okay! Keep your cape on! I'm sure there's chocolate or somethin' in here.

(Mr. Satan opens the cabinet door and gets bombarded by an avalanche of food in cans, bags, and boxes. Buu looks on, not amused as Mr. Satan reaches out for help under all of that food.)

Mr. Satan: Videl! Give your daddy a hand! I can't find the chocolate!!

(Cut to a shot of a book store)

Mr. Satan (o.c.): VIDEL!!!

(We see a book titled "Muzukashii Hon" in someone's hands as he walks down the sidewalk.)

Videl (o.c.): I can't believe we found it.

(We now see Videl walking alongside Gohan as Gohan is the one holding the book, sporting a new pair of yellow-rimmed glasses.)

Videl: Lucky you! You've wanted that book for a while.

Gohan: Oh, yeah! This is gonna make my research a whole lot easier!

(Gohan stops in his tracks as Videl keeps walking. She stops as well to see what's wrong.)

Gohan: Thanks, Videl. I'm not sure I deserve this though.

Videl: [lightly gasps] What's that mean? You've been studying like crazy.

Gohan: I know, but you keep buying me all these incredible gifts like this. And now I feel bad because I can't buy you anything.

Videl (o.c.): There's an easy fix for that. Just don't feel bad.

Gohan: Huh?

(Videl walks back over to Gohan.)

Videl: The best gift you can give me is to keep on studying hard, Gohan.

(Videl takes Gohan's arm in hers.)

Videl: Then, I'll have a scholar as arm candy.

(Gohan smiles appreciatively.)

Gohan: Deal.

Videl: [chuckles] Speaking of arm candy, I want something sweet. Let's try that bakery.

(Zoom out to a shot of Piccolo standing atop a building with his arms folded, watching over Gohan and Videl.)

Piccolo: Hmph!

(Cut to a shot of Capsule Corporation.)

Trunks (o.c.): A present?

(We now see Goten inside Trunks' house while Trunks his doing a handstand with just one finger.)

Goten: Yeah. My brother and Videl got married and I haven't gotten them anything. I wanna find a present that my new sister-in-law will love for sure!

Trunks: Oh... Something she'll love, huh?

(Trunks closes his eyes and strokes his chin thoughtfully. He reopens them after he gets an idea.)

Trunks: For girls. That pretty much means one thing.

Goten: What thing?

(Cut to a view of small engagement rings in a glass case.)

Jewelry store owner (o.c.): So, what do you think?

Rich woman: It's beautiful! But I can't ask you to buy me that, baby. It's too much!

Rich man: Nonsense, dear. I want to!

(The wealthy man points to another selection in the case.)

Rich man: Could we maybe have a look at that one?

(The store owner holds out a much larger diamond ring on display.)

Jewelry store owner: How about this one?

(The rich couple stare in awe at the impressive ring.)

Trunks (o.c.): Are these gag gifts? They're tiny.

Goten (o.c.): Maybe they're rings for babies.

(The woman now looks dissatisfied with the ring after hearing Trunks and Goten trash-talking them in the background.)

Trunks (o.c.): No way she'd be happy with one of these pebbles. You'll have to go way bigger. Unless they come with a magnifying glass!

Goten (o.c.): Yeah!

(The wealthy man is now looking agitated as the woman's expectations for the ring continue to rise.)

(Cut to the jewelry store owner as Trunks somehow towers over him. The store owner's eyebrow twitches impatiently.)

Jewelry store owner: Uhh, hello... Can I help you boys?

(We now see that Goten and Trunks are hovering over the rich couple, directly behind them, looking over the same rings they were. Goten looks off to the side.)

Goten: Over there, maybe?

Trunks: Let's go see.

(Goten and Trunks fly over in the direction behind them, freaking out the couple and store owner as the couple embraces each other in fear.)

(We see Goten and Trunks hovering over another counter as another sales clerk is throwing her hands up in the air in shock. Goten isn't impressed with this selection either.)

Goten: Nah, these are tiny too.

Trunks: You should get her something else.

Goten: All right.

(Goten and Trunks fly toward the exit and land on the ground before running out of the store. We now see the store owner and the rich couple just as stunned as they were a moment ago.)

Rich man: You see that?!

Rich woman: They can fly!

(The wealthy man's toupee falls off from all the excitement. After what those three just witnessed, nobody gives a care in the world about it.)

(Cut to a scene of a man gently prodding a woman's cheek to see how soft her skin is.)

Man: Whoa! Wow! Your skin really does feel softer now! Seriously, is it made of butter? I just can't stop touching your face!

(We see Goten and Trunks sitting down at a nearby park, still trying to think of the perfect gift.)

Goten: I don't know what to get her!

Trunks: Yeah, jewels are out. We gotta get creative. Hmm... How about o' de toletty?

Goten: O' de what now?

Trunks: It's fancy talk for "toilet water," and ladies like to put it on their face at night. At least my mom does.

(We see a flashback of Trunks brushing his teeth before bed as he watches his mom, Bulma, trying on lotions in front of the bathroom mirror.)

Bulma (o.c.): Smells nice, but it's wrong for my skin type.

Bulma: Well, maybe I should give it to Videl. She might think she's too young for skin care, but if she's not on it like me, one day she'll wake up looking like Master Roshi.

(Cut back to Goten and Trunks, who are happy with this new idea.)

Goten: Well, if your mom likes it, then I'm sure Videl will too, right?

Trunks: To the girly store!

Goten: Yeah!

(Goten and Trunks hop to their feet and take off into the sky.)

(Cut to a series of shots showing shelves of expensive lotions, going from 3,000 zeni, to 5,000 zeni, to one going all the way to 30,000 zeni.)

Goten: I can't afford this stuff on my allowance.

(Goten and Trunks hang their heads in defeat. Looks like it's back to the drawing board.)

(Cut to a shot of a displeased elderly man's mustached mouth as he shouts angrily at a sales clerk.)

Old man: 6,000 zeni! That's highway robbery!

(Goten and Trunks overhear him and turn around to see what the fuss is about.)

Old man (o.c.): Where do you get off charging that much?!

(We see the elderly man, holding himself up with a cane, as the cosmetics sales clerk tries to talk him down.)

Cosmetics sales woman: Well, sir. This is our ultra-advanced hydrating formula with rare, skin-nourishing compounds. You can find this anywhere else.

Old man: Like hell, I can't, missy! The hot springs back home work better than this fancy crap! And they don't cost me an arm and a leg!

(Cut back to Goten and Trunks listening on.)

Old man (o.c.): Three days soakin' in there is all you need! Even turns an old lady's skin smooth as a baby's butt!

(Goten and Trunks are surprised to hear this and run over to the elderly man.)

Trunks: Hey, old dude! Those hot springs! How do we get there, man?

Old man: 'Scuse me?

Trunks: The hot springs! The ones you just said are great for your skin, even for broke-down old lady butt!

Old man: Wow, you're a good eavesdropper.

(The elderly man bends over backward and points behind him.)

Old man: You go a looong way in that direction!

(The elderly man straightens himself out and points his cane and whole body over to the left.)

Old man: Then, at the woods, take a hard left!

(The elderly man now holds the cane up and holds his arms up as he moves his body around in a bizarre, swirling motion.)

Old man: And you'll find the spring swirling up in the mountains!

(Goten and Trunks exchanges excited glances and look back at the elderly man with excited faces.)

Goten & Trunks: Thank you, old dude!

(We now see Goten and Trunks flying over the grassy ground outside of town; Goten is carrying a glass jar.)

Trunks: "A long way in this direction..."

Goten: "Then at the woods, a hard left."

(Goten and Trunks follow the path they remember from the elderly man and fly off toward the mountains.)

Goten: Nothing's here.

Trunks: Hmm... Oh!

(Goten and Trunks look down to see what they can find, but Trunks has spotted something. They fly in for a closer look.)

Trunks: Is that it?

(We see the hot spring the elderly man was talking about. His description was heavily exaggerated, because it's revealed to be filled with filthy water as a bunch of elderly people are soaking in it. A close-up of an elderly man shows him sneezing his dentures out into the water.)

(Cut back to Goten and Trunks, who figure this can't be the hot spring the old man was talking about.)

Goten: That water looks kinda dirty, huh?

Trunks: Probably 'cuz all those nasty people are in it. Maybe let's go look higher up the mountain.

(We see a shot of a forest as Goten and Trunks fly overhead. Then cut back to Goten and Trunks looking over the area as they fly.)

Goten: Can't we just get it from a toilet?

(Trunks spots something again, but this time it's much more promising: a fresh-water lake hidden in the back of the forest.)

Trunks: Look, over there!

(Cut to a shot of a few fish swimming in the clean water.)

Goten (o.c.): Wow, it's crystal clear!

Goten: I bet she'll like that way better, right?

Trunks: Yeah!

(Goten and Trunks come down for a landing near the lake.)

Trunks: Perfect gift achieved!

(Cut to a shot of something green and scaly ominously slithering through the leaves.)

(We see Goten dipping his jar into the water to fill it up.)

Goten: All right... Little more!

(Goten dips the jar in deeper to try and fill it up faster.)

Goten: Fill up all the way!

Trunks: Careful, don't fall in.

Goten: I know, I know!

(We see a predator stalking Goten and Trunks from inside the bushes. A snake-like tongue flails out as the giant reptile hisses hungrily at them.)

(Goten takes his jar out of the water and sticks the cork back in, chuckling in success.)

Trunks: Nice! Let's head back.

Goten: M-hm!

(The giant snake lunges out at them from the bushes, separating Goten and Trunks as Goten looses his grip on the jar and it flies out of his hands. Trunks notices and lands on his feet, skidding to a stop.)

Trunks: Hold on, I got it!

(Trunks jumps back into the air and catches the jar with one hand just before it crashes to the ground, as he hops back up to avoid the snake coming in for a second attack.)

(Cut to a full frame view of the giant snake hissing viciously a Goten and Trunks. They aren't the least bit intimidated by it.)

Trunks: Hey, watch it, buddy! If you want toilet water, get your own!

(The snake lurches forward again as Trunks jumps out of the way. It keeps snapping its jaws at him, but Trunks dodges every strike. He then runs along the snake's tail and jumps up again to try and get away. The snake is still hot on his trail though, and gets closer and closer to chomping at him.)

Trunks: Goten!

(Trunks tosses the jar at Goten, who holds out his hands ready to catch it.)

Goten: Okay, I'm ready!

(Goten catches the jar, but the snake wraps itself around him and slithers around in tremulous motions, disorienting Goten.)

Goten: Trunks, here!

(Goten tosses the jar back at Trunks, who is now back on solid ground. He catches it easily.)

Trunks: Right!

(The snake's shadow covers Trunks as it goes in for another bite, but Trunks dashes out of the way with superhuman speed. Now he's getting annoyed...)

Trunks: Hey! Knock it off!

(Trunks kicks the snake, but it barely even fazes it. Goten tries punching it in the face, which ends up dealing much better damage. The snake angrily goes in for the kill again, but Goten and Trunks keep hopping out of its way, the jar still in Trunks' hands.)

Trunks: He doesn't quit, does he?!

(Goten jumps up and hops off of the snake to give him a boost as he lands back to the ground and charges a Kamehame-Ha. Trunks is alarmed by this.)

Trunks: Hang on, Goten, no! You're too close to the hot springs, it's too dangerous!

(Cut to a shot of the elderly hot springs, showing all of the people who could accidentally get caught in Goten's blast. Cut back to Goten, who calls off the attack and takes to the air to avoid another lunge by the snake. Trunks tosses the jar up at him again.)

Trunks: Your turn, catch!

(The snake bats the jar away with its tail before Goten can catch it. Trunks has had all he can stand at this point... He lunges at the snake and punches it through the entire forest and into a large tree. He readies himself to deliver another beat-down, but the snake is aghast and withdraws into the woods to escape.)

(Trunks returns to Goten to check out the damages.)

Trunks: Is the jar messed up?

(Cut to a shot of Goten from behind. We can tell he's holding the jar, but we have no idea what kind of condition it's in. Goten then turns around and smiles as he holds up the jar filled with lake water, completely intact without a scratch on it.)

(Cut to a shot of a large red house in Satan City. We then see Videl stirring a pot on the stove.

Trunks (o.c.): Yoo-hoo, Videl!

(Trunks' voice can be heard in the background along with light tapping on windowed glass.)

Videl: Huh?

(Videl turns around smiling, already knowing who to expect. She sees Goten and Trunks hovering outside of her window, smiling and chuckling back at her. Goten is holding his arms behind his back.)

(We see Goten and Trunks now inside the house as Goten holds out his present.)

Goten: Here! It's my mega-special wedding gift!

Videl: Wow! That's for me? That's so thoughtful. Thanks, Goten.

Gohan (o.c.): Goten! Trunks! When'd you get here?

(Gohan walks into the room, happy to see his little brother and childhood friend.)

Goten: Hey, Gohan!

(Gohan notices the jar of water that Videl is holding.)

Gohan: Hm? Hey, what's that?

Videl: This is a wedding gift, from your little brother.

Goten: It's toilet water!

Gohan: Uhh... What?

Goten: It's for her face! Trunks helped me get it up on a mountain!

(Trunks smiles and chuckles proudly as Videl tries to piece together what they could mean.)

Videl: You mean eau de toilette. Sounds like you went to a lot of trouble.

Trunks: Don't you wanna try some?

Videl: Sure!

(Videl drops some of the water into the palm of her hand and rubs it together as she applies it to her face. She's surprised by how it feels.)

Videl: (thinking) Is this just ordinary water?

(Videl sees Goten and Trunks smiling and chuckling proudly over their accomplishment. She smiles knowingly and continues to rub it on her cheeks.)

Trunks (o.c.): Pretty smooth, huh?

Goten: You like it?!

Videl: Yeah, it's great! My skin feels incredible! Thanks, Goten, and thank you, Trunks. I'm a lucky girl!

(Goten and Trunks are beaming in excitement and chuckle happily.)

Goten: Well, just let me know if you run out! I'll get you more anytime!

(Videl nods her head and chuckles sweetly.)

(Fade to a view of Goku watching the sunset with Goten out on the field Goku works at.)

Goku: You did a really good thing, Goten. I'm sure you made Videl's day.

Goten: [chuckles]

Goku: So, what's their house like?

Goten: It's super big!

Goku: Well, Mr. Satan had it built, so I bet it is. Sure was nice of him. Now Gohan can study all he wants and not worry about bills!

(We hear a vehicle rolling up as a car horn lightly beeps at Goku and Goten. They turn around to see a black car nearby slowing to a stop with the word "Satan" printed on the side. Mr. Satan himself steps out of the vehicle.)

Mr. Satan: Hey, there! Great to see ya, Goku!

(Mr. Satan slowly walks toward Goku and Goten, carrying a briefcase.)

Mr. Satan: I've been looking for ya! Chi-Chi told me you'd be up here.

Goku (o.c.): Oh, hey, Mr. Satan!

Goku: Well, that's funny, we were just talkin' about you. You're a good man. I can't thank you enough for buying that huge house for Gohan.

(Mr. Satan sets the briefcase down on the ground as he walks up to Goku and Goten.)

Mr. Satan: It was my pleasure! I mean, what do ya expect? Videl's my baby girl!

(Mr. Satan gets serious for a moment and whispers into Goku's ear.)

Mr. Satan: (whispering) But enough about the house, that's not why I'm here. Did you happen to see the news today?

Goku: (trying to whisper back) No. I don't watch T.V.

Mr. Satan (no longer whispering) All right then, I'll tell ya. I got an award today, grand prize in fact, from the World Peace Assembly, for savin' the Earth from certain doom.

Goku: Ya don't say.

Mr. Satan: Yeah. You might remember how it kinda got around that I saved the world from Armageddon?

(Pan to the briefcase as Mr. Satan continues to explain his business being there.)

Mr. Satan: Well, that's what it's for. And the prize money is, uhh, substantial: 100,000,000 zeni.

(Cut to Mr. Satan's agent, Miss Piiza, leaning against the car as Goku and Goten scream out in surprise. She turns her head curiously.)

Goku & Goten: 100,000,000?!?!?!

(Mr. Satan shushes them harshly, and they immediately obey by covering their own mouths.)

(Mr. Satan sighs in relief and picks up the briefcase once again. He smiles and holds it up to Goku.)

Mr. Satan: But the point is, you're the only one who really deserves this dough. So I'm handin' it over.

(Goku holds up his hands to stop him. He is not comfortable with this idea.)

Goku: Whoa, whoa! I can't accept that!

Mr. Satan: Come on, don't be silly, you earned it, brother!

(Mr. Satan holds the briefcase out closer to Goku, but Goku tries to push it away.)

Goku: No, seriously, I'm fine, I wasn't the only one fighting him! You did your part too... in your own way!

Mr. Satan: But I've already got too much money to count!

(Goku has nearly pushed the briefcase all the way back into Mr. Satan's chest by now.)

Mr. Satan: Besides, Vegeta... said no too. Heh! But of course, that guy's married into the richest family on Earth!

Goku: Hold on.

(Goku whispers into Mr. Satan's ear.)

Goku: (whispering) How much is 100,000,000 zeni? Is that more than 100,000?

Mr. Satan: Huh? Eh, well, yeah! Of course! Let's see, it's uhh... a thousand times more in fact?

(Goku recoils after hearing this. He looks terrified by the prospect.)

Goku: Aah! A thousand times more than 100,000?!

(Goku backs up and shakes his hands at Mr. Satan in protest.)

Goku: Well, now I really don't want it!

(Cut to Goten, looking on with an impressionable expression.)

Goku: Where would I put it?! I don't have a treasure cave!

Goten: I... think you should take it, dad.

Goku: Huh?

Goten: If you come home with all of that money, then mom won't worry about you having a job. So you could go train with King Kai.

(Goku looks at him excitedly.)

Goku: Ya think so? Uh...

(Goku looks back at Mr. Satan and rubs the back of his neck guiltily.)

Goku: But it's so much...

Mr. Satan: Come on, Goku. Listen to your boy and take the cash. I swear it won't bite.

(Goku's very conflicted, he's really on the fence about taking this money. He groans reluctantly a little before putting on a serious face as he comes to a decision.)

Goku: Fine, I'll take it! We could use the money. So, you're sure you don't want it?

(Mr. Satan nods his head as Goku hesitantly reaches out to take the handle of the briefcase.)

Goku: Well, okay... Thank you.

Mr. Satan: Yeah! That's a relief! Now, uhh... I hate askin' for somethin' in return here, but... can you keep this on the lowdown?

(Cut to Goku and Goten eyeing the briefcase in Goku's hand.)

Mr. Satan: I got a reputation to protect.

(Goku and Goten blink simultaneously in confusion.)

(Cut to Goku and Chi-Chi's house at night with the lights still on inside.)

Chi-Chi (o.c.): 100,000,00 ZENI?!?!?!

(Cut to a shot of the money in the briefcase, dispersed in 10,000 zeni bills with an image of Tori-Bot featured on each bill.)

(We see Chi-Chi patting Goku's back for a job well done while she lustfully stares at the pile of cash in front of her. Goten is in the room as well, standing right next to them as this plays out.)

Chi-Chi: I don't even know what to say, Goku! With this money, we can afford any school we want for Goten! And lots of private tutors and anything else he needs! It's a dream!

Goku: I'm glad you like it. So, uhh... I was wondering if I could, ya know, train with King Kai now?

Chi-Chi: (absentmindedly) Yeah, sure. Just drop by from time to time, okay?

(Goku grins widely upon hearing this.)

Goku: Awesome!

(Goku glances at Goten, who smiles up at him, happy for his dad.)

Goku: All right, then! See ya soon!

(Goku places his index and middle fingers on his forehead to use the Instant Transmission technique and teleport out of the house.)

(Cut back to the outside view of Goku and Chi-Chi's house.)

Chi-Chi (o.c.): I'm gonna start looking for tutors right now, and private schools, and after-school schools! Goten, you're gonna know everything!

(We see Master Roshi barreling toward the house, running full-speed in crazed excitement.)

Master Roshi: Yea-heah!!!

(Master Roshi barges into the house looking for Goku, and ends up in the same room with Chi-Chi.)

Master Roshi: Goku! Is it true you really got 100,000,000 zeni?! That's a game-changer! Do you have any idea how many dirty movie DVDs you could buy with that kind of load?!

(Slow zoom in on the back of Chi-Chi's head. You can tell she's about to unleash her patented maternal wrath on the deluded old man.)

Master Roshi: YOU COULD EVEN GO BLU-RAY!!!

(Chi-Chi turns to face him, growling angrily with literal fire in her steely, furious glare.)

Chi-Chi: YOU THINK I'D LET YOU BLOW OUR MONEY ON FILTH?!?!?!

(Chi-Chi kicks Master Roshi out of the house and he hightails it out of there.)

(Slow pan up to the cloudy night sky. A twinkle of light shines in the distance. Fade into the soulless black pupil of Kibito Kai, and slowly zoom out as he stares up at the sky with mounting apprehension. Blustering winds race through the Sacred World of the Kais where Kibito Kai is standing and the Elder Kai is watching in awe.)

Kibito Kai: Ancestor... Another planet has been decimated. Just what could be happening out there?

Elder Kai: Hmm...

(Cut to a shot of the purple sky as a handful of planets can be seen in the distance, varying in size and proximity.)

[opening]


Narrator: Last time on Dragon Ball...

Mercenary Tao: If I were to pay you, it would make me look weaker.

Tailor: Please, sir. I meant no disrespect. I only ask for what is mine.

Mercenary Tao: Yes. You have made that clear.

Tailor: No no! No no- (Tao pokes the tailor's head with his Pressure Point Attack kills him)

Mercenary Tao: (evil giggle) I believe I made my point.


[Tao falls in to the ground, Goku stands to the ground, wind blows, Mercenary Tao jumps out of the ground with his suit torn off, and the wind blows again]


Mercenary Tao: (enraged) That's the second suit you've destroyed! (growls) Do you have any idea how difficult it's going to be to find another descent tailor!? (growls again)

Goku: You should worry about your fight. Not your looks.

Mercenary Tao: [furious] You dare question my abilities!? Well... Then tase my Dodon ray!

[Goku growls]

Upa: Be careful, Goku!

Goku: Go ahead! I'm ready for you this time!

Mercenary Tao: Dodon...

[growls and takes a blast to Goku, blocks the ray with his hands causing his hands to burn, and Tao freaks out and snot comes out of his first nostrol]

Goku: That burned. [blows his hands]

Mercenary Tao: It's impossible. No one has ever withstood that attack.

Goku: It can't hurt me anymore! Just like my Kamehameha wave didn't work on you last time. I guess we're even.

Upa: Yeah! You did it!


[The music Reminded by Drowning Pool plays]

Bardock: Frieza! I'm coming for you, you murderous self-serving traitor! It's over!

Frieza's soldiers: All hail, Lord Frieza!

Bardock: [Chuckling] No way, Frieza. You lived long enough! Actually it's been too long far for my taste. Frieza, listen up! We quit! All of us! Got it!? We don't work for you anymore! We're free! You can find someone else to do your dirty work! Oh yeah! [Chuckling] There's one last thing... [Charges a Final Spirit Cannon]

Narrator: Deployed on a routine military operation, the Saiyan baby Kakarot flies toward Earth, missing the deadly surprise attack on his home planet. His father Bardock confronts the assailants, Frieza and his entire army, alone.

Bardock: This is for all the people we killed in your name! Here, have it! [launches a Final Spirit Cannon]

Frieza: [Evil Laughter]

[uses his Death Ball, as the Final Spirit Cannon has no effect on the Death Ball]

Bardock: No way!

[Everyone screams, as Bardock gets hit by the Death Ball, causing his armor to disintegrate; inside a nearby spaceship, Cooler and his henchmen watch Bardock's death]

Dore: That's the guy right there, Bardock.

Salza: He doesn't look so frightening to me. Anyway, he's space dust now. And there goes the whole monkey farm. Now, this is light entertainment. [Salza notices Goku in his space pod.]

Hm? What's this? Someone's getting away! Magnify the image!

Neiz: Right, I'm on it Salza!

Salza: I want an interior view as well!

Neiz: That's it, got it.

Salza: Where does he think he's going?!

Neiz: It looks like he's heading towards a planet called Earth! Intercept course?

Salza: Yes.

Cooler: Belay that order.

Doore: Sire!

Neiz: Yes sir!

Salza: But.. someone is escaping!

Cooler: Frieza is the one in charge of this quadrant, let him clean up his own mess. I've got seven planets to destroy by the end of the day. Why should I allow myself to get behind schedule just to cover his mistake?

Besides, he's just a Saiyan child. He's no threat to us. [Cooler stares at Frieza laughing on the monitor.]

Ah, look at him! What foolishness! He's so pleased with that himself he's blinded by his arrogant pride! That could be King Vegeta on that space pod for all he knows!

You've got a lot to learn, brother. Let's get out of here!

[Opening]

[at Roshi's Island, Goku trains and launches Kamehameha on the water]

Master Roshi: Look at that! I can see clear to the main land, Goku! That's amazing!

Goku: Awesome huh? Watch this. I can make the walls go higher!

Master Roshi (thinking to himself): Remarkable. He's never trained harder, but he's so relaxed and talkative about it. Beating Frieza changed him.

[[[Goku's House]]]

Gohan: [Doing work] There... divide that by 10...

Chi-Chi: Hi! I thought my little scholar might be thirsty. Here's some tea. [Notices Icarus in window] Hm? Hey! What do think you're doing? I know what you're up to. Now you get out of here.

Goku: Icarus, leave Gohan alone, he's trying to finish his homework.

Chi-Chi: What? Did you hear what your father just said? He told Icarus to leave you alone because you were doing your... homework. Goku? Are you feeling ok, honey?

Goku: Oh yeah, I'm feeling just fine.

Chi-Chi: Are you sure you don't have a fever, Goku? You sound a little strange.

Goku: No, I feel great. I just want Gohan to finish his homework.

Chi-Chi: Yep, I knew it, I knew it. Goku has never cared if you finish your homework. Gohan, I'm afraid there's something seriously wrong with your father. I wonder if all this fighting has finally knocked a few screws loose in Goku's head. That's it! He must have bruised his brain...


Gohan: Betcha never thought you could fly this fast. Did ya? [Giggling, as Salza, Neiz and Dore pop out]

Salza: So, going somewhere, monkey boy?

Gohan: Uh oh! Icarus, let's get out of here, quick!

Dore: Let em have it, Salza!

Neiz: [Laughing]

[Salza launches his Finger Beam attack on Icarus' wings as Gohan loses control, and the music Falling Down by Breaking Point plays]

Gohan: It's okay I gotcha. [Dore kicks Gohan causing Icarus to fall in the woods] Icarus! [The Armored Squadron hit Gohan causing Dore to grab Gohan}

Dore: [chuckling] Huh? Hey, whatcha got in the bag there, monkey boy. [uses his hands to get the bad] Give it here. Give it. Alright! That's it! You're going bye-bye, kid! [Gohan growls in frustration] I call this mine can-opener with your attack. [he gets blasted in the back by an energy blast]

Neiz: Dore!

Dore: Who did that!?

Piccolo: That would be me!

Salza: A Namek? Out here?

Dore: [about Planet Namek] Why isn't that toad on his own world where he belongs?

Neiz: Frieza blew it up.

Dore: Oh, oh yeah. Yeah.

Gohan: Yeah. Piccolo.

Dore: [to Piccolo] It's all over for you, Namek! You're going to die!

Piccolo: Not likely. [takes off his turban] I've seen you fight.

Dore: I'M GOING RIP YOU APART!!! [Launches up and punches Piccolo's cape] Where'd he go!

[Piccolo appears and hits Dore in the helmet causing him to fall to the ground]

Dore: DARN IT!! I...CAN'T... [blasts Doore, he screams and dies and explodes]

Neiz: Dore. [to Piccolo] You're dead! [growls in frustration, when using a pink shock wave with Piccolo fighting with Salza] Have it! [blasts Piccolo]

Salza: [Evil laughter] You look like a buch of dear caught in the headlights! [Laughs evilly] You lose suckers! Now die! [Piccolo launches a Special Beam Cannon and shot Salza in the back, as he starts gasping, and falls over]

Goku and Krillin: Huh?

Gohan: I don't see him. [giggles] Piccolo! I know you're there! Come out! Piccolo!

[later, Piccolo drinks water, and regenerates as the song Phoneix by Breaking Point plays]
